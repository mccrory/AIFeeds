<p>Hungary is a most intriguing country. Among the many mysteries that surround <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary" target="_blank">Magyarország</a>, the <em>Magyar</em> language is one of the most fascinating. Hungarian history, albeit occasionally tragic, is also quite interesting. In particular, how was it possible for Hungary to spawn so many brilliant intellectuals and artists during the (relatively) short life of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary" target="_blank">Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy</a> (1867-1918)?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://stochastix.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/von-neumann-memorial-lectures.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6178 aligncenter" style="border:1px solid black;" title="von neumann memorial lectures" src="http://stochastix.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/von-neumann-memorial-lectures.jpg?w=342&#038;h=321" alt="" width="342" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>In <a href="http://stochastix.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/the-social-construction-of-hungarian-genius.pdf" target="_blank"><em>The Social Construction of Hungarian Genius</em></a> [1], <a href="http://www.franktibor.hu" target="_blank">Tibor Frank</a> attempts to answer this question by providing &#8220;a broader background — historical, social, intellectual, and cultural — to understanding the admirable creativity in early 20th century Hungary, with the mathematician and scientist John von Neumann (1903-1957) in center focus&#8221;. Frank argues that the social and cultural transformations that Hungary went through after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867" target="_blank">Compromise of 1867</a>, among which:</p>
<ul>
<li>the decline of feudalism and the emergence of a middle-class.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the assimilation of Jews and ethnic Germans in Hungarian society (a process he calls &#8220;Magyarization&#8221;).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the influence of German culture in Hungarian mathematics, science, music, and education system.</li>
</ul>
<p>created the conditions for a new intellectual elite to emerge. The leadership of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zsef_E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s" target="_blank">József Eötvös</a> and his son <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lor%C3%A1nd_E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s" target="_blank">Loránd Eötvös</a>, the excellence of high-school teachers such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_R%C3%A1tz" target="_blank">László Rátz</a> and <a href="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikola_S%C3%A1ndor" target="_blank">Sándor Mikola</a>, the foundation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6z%C3%A9piskolai_Matematikai_%C3%A9s_Fizikai_Lapok" target="_blank">Középiskolai Matematikai Lapok</a> by Dániel Arany, and the establishment of the <a href="http://teo.elte.hu/fs/history/eotvcomp.html" target="_blank">Eötvös Competition</a> led to the discovery, nurturing, and training of exceptional students such as von Neumann, von Kármán, Wigner, Szilárd, Teller, among many others.</p>
<p>In 1918, with the end of World War I and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, Hungary underwent a period of political turmoil that forced some of the Budapest intellectual elite to exile, first in Germany, and later in the United States. Frank&#8217;s book [2] focuses on such migrations.</p>

From Alan Zibel at the WSJ: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704889404576277311556543874.html">Home Builders' Outlook Stays Fragile</a><br />
<blockquote>Wells Fargo Securities projects only modest increases over the next two years, with 330,000 new-home sales likely this year, followed by 440,000 in 2012. It is likely to take another three years before new-home sales return to healthy annual sales of around 770,000, said Wells Fargo economist Anika Khan.</blockquote>That is a little more optimistic than my <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/thoughts-on-residential-investment.html">outlook</a>. The key will be how long it takes to absorb all the excess vacant housing units. The pickup in residential investment this year will be mostly from apartments and home improvement, but eventually we will see an increase in new home sales. <br />
<br />
I haven't forecast new home sales for 2012 yet, but Khan's forecast of 440 thousand sales next year is still for one of the lowest years on record - and yet that would be a 33% increase in sales from her forecast for this year. If her forecast is close that would give a nice boost to employment and GDP. <br />
<br />
But for the home builders right now, it is "wait until next year" once again.<br />

<div>Content:
Before taxes were due, Jon Kleinberg spoke at the Simons Science Series on Social Networks. Quite simply, Jon is the Carl Sagan of the Computer Science Universe. He switched between<br /><ul><li>science (Quoted Pauli that one could not even think of a wrong model; Martian's question, Is there life on Earth?),<br /></li><li>technologies (karate clubs, wiki, epinions, flickr, emails, and of course facebook and gmail),<br /></li><li>theories (structural social theories of balance, peer factors in social evaluations: people have negative opinion of peoplewhose level of achievement is similar to theirs),<br /></li><li>theoretical CS (random graph modeling of dynamics, convergence analysis of local phenomena, rank 1 matrix encoded in data, random walk that returns to origin),<br /></li><li>some truly fun experiments with data ( use flicker photo locations and abstract out a world map of population centers -- you can find the line outside a sushi restaurant if you used facebook data!;  what is the prob that you answer a mail within X min?), and<br /></li><li>great oneliners (on social networks, everyone gets a line; incredible richness of graphs; in 2000 at IBM we wondered if only we had a website where people will register and tell us where they live, and how long will it take for that to happen; we prefer facebook to enemybook; software knows you  better than you do; we live in networks)<br /></li></ul>to enthrall the entire audience, and inspire them to step out of the talk, and start asking questions about the native social world online and around them, and use whatever tools --- percolation, statistics, graphs --- they have handy and start digging.<br /><br />Some morsels from the feast: gmail could tell you when you are tired and not being productive; same place and same time flicker upload  is sufficient correlation to associate the different uploaders tightly -- like they are a family or belong to the same conference; is there a balance theory like enemy-of-a-friend-is an-enemy for asymmetric networks?; how long will controversial topics exposed via say twitter hashtags survive?; etc.<br /><br />Also, he made wiki -- at least the wiki administration that "grants tenure" to those with &gt; = 10k edits after a vote on their portfolio -- sound cool. Finally, it is also cool to see Jon interact with many communities smoothly, go from talking about ergodicity to "like spin systems but spins here are on edges; gauge theory in physics, problem of removing frustrations".<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21129445-898779782773775296?l=mysliceofpizza.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></div>

<h2>Six More Reasons for Doubting a Regression Model</h2>
<p>There are more than a few reasons for being skeptical about a regression model. Some are easy to identify, others are more subtle. Here are six more reasons you might doubt the validity of a regression model.</p>
<h2>Overfitting</h2>
<div id="attachment_613" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://statswithcats.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/overfit.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-613" title="Overfit" src="http://statswithcats.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/overfit.jpg?w=300&#038;h=212" alt="" width="300" height="212" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Overfit? No way. I fit perfectly.</p></div>
<p>Overfitting involves building a statistical model solely by optimizing statistical parameters, and usually involves using a large number of variables and <a href="http://statswithcats.wordpress.com/2010/11/21/fifty-ways-to-fix-your-data/">transformations of the variables</a>. The resulting model may fit the data almost perfectly but will produce erroneous results when applied to another sample from the population.</p>
<p>The concern about overfitting may be somewhat overstated. Overfitting is like becoming too muscular from weight training. It doesn&#8217;t happen suddenly or simply. If you know what overfitting is, you&#8217;re not likely to become a victim. It&#8217;s not something that happens in a keystroke. It takes a lot of work fine tuning variables and what not. It&#8217;s also usually easy to identify overfitting in other people&#8217;s models. Simply look for a conglomeration of manual numerical adjustments, mathematical functions, and variable combinations.</p>
<h2>Misspecification</h2>
<p>Misspecification involves including terms in a model that make the model look great statistically even though the model is problematical. Often, misspecification involves placing the same or very similar variable on both sides of the equation.</p>
<p>Consider this example from <a href="http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/govtsize/govtsize.htm">economics</a>. A model for the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was developed using data on government spending and unemployment from 1947 to 1997. The model:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">GDP = (121*Spending) &#8211; (3.5*Spending<sup>2</sup>) + (136*Time) &#8211; (61*Unemployment) &#8211; 566</p>
<p>had an R-squared value of 0.9994. Such a high R-squared value is a signal that something is amiss. R-squared values that high are usually only seen in models involving equipment calibration, and certainly not anything involving capricious human behavior. A closer look at the study indicated that the model term involving spending were an index of the government&#8217;s outlays relative to the economy. Usually, <a href="http://statswithcats.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/it’s-all-relative/">indexing a variable</a> to a baseline or standard is a good thing to do. In this case, though, the spending index was the proportion of government outlays per the GDP. Thus, the model was:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">GDP = (121*Outlays/GDP) &#8211; (3.5* (Outlays/GDP)<sup>2</sup>) + (136*Time) &#8211; (61*Unemployment) &#8211; 566</p>
<p>GDP appears on both sides of the equation, thus accounting for the near perfect correlation. This is a case in which an index, at least one involving the dependent variable, should not have been used.</p>
<p>Another misspecification involves creating a <a href="http://statswithcats.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/the-seeds-of-a-model/">prediction model </a>having independent variables that are more difficult, time consuming, or expensive to generate than the dependent variable. You might as well just measure the dependent variable when you need to know its value. Similarly with forecasting (prediction of the future) models, if you need to forecast something a year in advance, don&#8217;t use predictors that are measured less than a year in advance.</p>
<h2>Multicollinearity</h2>
<p>Multicollinearity occurs when a model has two or more independent variables that are highly correlated with each other. The consequences are that the model will look fine, but predictions from the model will be erratic. It&#8217;s like a football team. The players perform well together but you can&#8217;t necessarily tell how good individual players are. The team wins, yet in some situations, the cornerback or offensive tackle will get beat on most every play.</p>
<p>If you ever tried to use independent variables that add to a constant, you&#8217;ve seen multicollinearity in action. In the case of perfect correlations, such as these, statistical software will crash because it won&#8217;t be able to perform the matrix mathemagics of regression. Most instances of multicollinearity involve weaker correlations that allow statistical software to function, yet the predictions of the model will still be erratic.</p>
<p>Multicollinearity occurs often in the social sciences and other fields of study in which many variables are measured in the process of model building. Diagnosis of the problem is simple if you have access to the data. Look at correlations between the independent variables. You can also look at the <a href="http://statswithcats.wordpress.com/2010/12/19/you%E2%80%99re-off-to-be-a-wizard/">variance inflation factors</a>, reciprocals of one minus the R-squared values for the independent variables and the dependent variable. VIFs are measures of how much the model&#8217;s coefficients change because of multicollinearity. The VIF for a variable should be less than 10 and ideally near 1.</p>
<p>If you suspect multicollinearity, don&#8217;t worry about the model but don&#8217;t believe any of the predictions.</p>
<h2>Heteroscedasticity</h2>
<div id="attachment_615" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 233px"><a href="http://statswithcats.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/homoscedasticity1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-615" title="Homoscedasticity" src="http://statswithcats.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/homoscedasticity1.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="" width="223" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I said homoscedasticity! Now get off of me.</p></div>
<p>Regression, and practically all parametric statistics, requires that the variances in the model residuals be equal at every value of the dependent variable. This assumption is called equal variances, homogeneity of variances, or coolest of all, <a href="http://statswithcats.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/assuming-the-worst/">homoscedasticity</a>. Violate the assumption and you have heteroscedasticity.</p>
<p>Heteroscedasticity is assessed much more commonly in analysis of variance models than in regression models. This is probably because the dependent variable in ANOVA is measured on a categorical scale while the dependent variable in regression is measured on a continuous scale. The solution to this is fairly simple. Break the dependent variable scale into intervals, like in a histogram, and calculate the variance for each interval. The variances don&#8217;t have to be precisely equal, but variances different by a factor of five are problematical. Unequal variances will wreak havoc on any tests or confidence limits calculated for model predictions.</p>
<h2>Autocorrelation</h2>
<p>Autocorrelation involves a variable being correlated with itself. It is the correlation between data points with the previously listed data points (termed a <em>lag</em>). <a name="OLE_LINK28"></a>Usually, autocorrelation involves <a href="http://statswithcats.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/time-is-on-my-side/">time-series data </a>or spatial data, but it can also involve the order in which data are collected. The terms autocorrelation and serial correlation are often used interchangeably. If the data points are collected at a constant time interval, the term <em>autocorrelation</em> is more typically used.</p>
<p>If the residuals of a model are autocorrelated, it&#8217;s a sure bet that the variances will also be unequal. That means, again, that tests or confidence limits calculated from variances should be suspect.</p>
<p>To check a variable or residuals from a model for autocorrelation, you can conduct a Durban-Watson test. The Durban-Watson test statistic ranges from 0 to 4. If the statistic is close to 2.0, then serial correlation is not a problem. Most statistical software will allow you to conduct this test as part of a regression analysis.</p>
<h2>Weighting</h2>
<div id="attachment_616" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://statswithcats.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/weighting.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-616" title="Weighting" src="http://statswithcats.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/weighting.jpg?w=300&#038;h=263" alt="" width="300" height="263" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#039;m important so I weigh more.</p></div>
<p>Most software that calculates regression parameters also allows you to weight the data points. You might want to do this for several reasons. Weighting is used to make more reliable or relevant data points more important in model building. It&#8217;s also used when each data point represents more than one value. The issue with weighting is that it will change the degrees of freedom, and hence, the results of statistical tests. Usually this is OK, a necessary change to accommodate the realities of the model. However, if you ever come upon a weighted least squares regression model in which the weightings are arbitrary, perhaps done by an analyst who doesn&#8217;t understand the consequence, don&#8217;t believe the test results.</p>
<h2>No Doubts</h2>
<p>So, there are six more reasons for doubting a regression model. These are a bit more sophisticated than the last five reasons, and though they might appear less often, they are still good reasons for doubting a regression model. You just have to be able to diagnose and treat the regression maladies. But that is a topic for another time.</p>

<p>There is a lot of discussion on the role the word &#8220;analytics&#8221; should play in operations research.  As a field, we have always had a bit of an identity issue.  Perhaps &#8220;analytics&#8221; is the way we should go.  Generally, I am supportive of this:  I am part of a group that put together a<a href="http://tepper.cmu.edu/mba/mba-programs-coursework/mba-tracks/business-analytics/index.aspx"> &#8220;Business Analytics&#8221; track</a> for my business school&#8217;s MBA program, and am delighted with how it resonates with both students and employers.</p>
<p><a href="http://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nytime_mostblogged.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1440" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="nytime_mostblogged" src="http://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nytime_mostblogged.jpg" alt="NY Times Most Blogged" width="595" height="343" /></a>Then, there are times where I feel we should run away screaming.  Today&#8217;s <em>New York Times Magazine</em> continues its &#8220;Analytics&#8221; graphics with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2011/04/24/magazine/24Analytics-box.html?scp=1&amp;sq=most-blogged&amp;st=cse">a diagram on its most blogged articles</a>.  I include a local copy here, for I truly hope that a New York Times editor will feel sufficiently chagrined to remove it from the website and, ideally, from the memory of any who gazed at it.</p>
<p>First, the New York Times has decided to show this as a form of a Venn Diagram.  In this case, intersections should mean something.  What would they mean?  Since the underlying statistic is something like &#8220;blogs that mention the article&#8221;, presumably the intersection is blogs that mention both articles (or more if multiple circles intersect).  But is this even possible?  It appears that no blog mentions 4 articles (really?  there is no blog covering essentially all of what the<em> New York Times</em> is doing?), and the only 3 articles mentioned by 3 blogs are articles 1, 2, and 3 (unless maybe there is an intersection with 4, 5, and 6:  the diagram is not clear).  Is that even remotely possible?   There seem to be lots of blogs that mention 2 of the articles.   I can&#8217;t believe that there is no blog that covered both #1 (&#8220;aggregation&#8221;) and #4 (&#8220;20 year olds&#8221;), particularly since there were blogs that covered each along with #3 (&#8220;Lindsey Graham&#8221;).  The convenience of putting the circles from #1 down to #5 seems to have trumped any realistic representation of the intersections.</p>
<p>Second, this is supposed to be coverage of the last 12 months.  But #1 has been out about 6 weeks, while #5 has been out almost a year.  Is this raw data or is corrected for the different amount of time out?  There is certainly no clue from the graphic.</p>
<p>Third, while there is often controversy over the space needed to graphically display relatively little data, here is a great example where much of the data is not even shown!  The graphic says that it is based &#8220;from the 15,000 blogs tracked by Blogrunner&#8221;, but shows nothing about how often each article was blogged.  All we get are the relative values, not the absolutes.  And did they do the graph relative to radius or area?  You would hope area, but without the base data, there is no checking.</p>
<p>If this is what &#8220;Analytics&#8221; is, then operations research should have nothing to do with it.  And the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> editorial team had better think long and hard if they are qualified to put out &#8220;analytics&#8221; results in their otherwise admirable magazine.</p>

<div>Description: </div>
<div>Content:
In my <a href="http://www.machinedlearnings.com/2011/04/semi-supervised-lda-part-ii.html">previous post</a> I discussed the idea of semi-supervised LDA: constructing a topic model on a corpus where some of the documents have an associated label, but most do not.  The goal is to extract topics that are informed by all the text in the corpus (like unsupervised LDA) but are also predictive of the observed label (like supervised LDA).<br /><br /><h4>Supervised Results</h4>In my previous post I didn't indicate how to compute $p (y | w)$, i.e., the distribution of document labels given the document text.  Following the<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/papers/lacoste-sha-jordan-nips08.pdf"> DiscLDA paper</a> I used the harmonic mean estimator (the <a href="http://radfordneal.wordpress.com/2008/08/17/the-harmonic-mean-of-the-likelihood-worst-monte-carlo-method-ever/">worst Monto Carlo method ever</a>), but I only use a sample size of 1 (the worst sample size ever).  What this means in practice is:<br /><ol><li> For each label $y$</li><ol><li> Draw $z \sim p (\cdot | w, y)$ using the Gibbs sampler conditioned upon the label.</li><li> Compute $p (w | z, y) =  \prod_i \frac{n^{(w_i)}_{-d, u^k_{z_i}} + \beta}{n^{(\cdot)}_{-d, u^k_{z_i}} + W \beta}.$</li><li> Estimate $p (w | y) \approx p (w | z, y)$.</li></ol><li> Compute unnormalized posterior $p (y | w) \propto p (w | y) p (y)$ and normalize.</li></ol>On fully labeled data sets (i.e., supervised learning) this gives good results.  Here's the result of a supervised run,<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mcHkLGIwgQ8/TbSGPNrr0qI/AAAAAAAAAL0/QbXeibO-ANs/s1600/plot-supervised.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="300" width="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mcHkLGIwgQ8/TbSGPNrr0qI/AAAAAAAAAL0/QbXeibO-ANs/s400/plot-supervised.png" /></a></div>There's no other classifier here: 0/1 loss is being determined based upon the posterior distribution of labels given the document text as generated by the LDA procedure.<br /><br />You might ask: how come the classifier doesn't drive the loss on the training set to zero?  Well loss here is assessed by (temporarily) removing the document from the training set and then running the inference algorithm to get the label posterior.  This is still a biased estimator of generalization performance, but it is somewhat conservative.  Actual 0/1 loss on a test set was around 0.23 (i.e., 77% accurate).<br /><br />Next you might ask: only 77%?  As I indicated in a <a href="http://www.machinedlearnings.com/2011/03/regarding-leveraging-twitter-social.html">previous post</a>, predicting gender from a user's set of followers is challenging, mainly because I've only labeled a small fraction of the data and the popular twitter accounts (i.e., most likely to be followed) tend not to be gender dispositive.  I am able to predict the gender of a twitter user quite accurately, but I have to combine the multiple sources of information in the twitter account, of which the social graph is merely one component.  In my experience 77% accuracy using only follower information is really good relative to other things I've tried.  In particular doing an unsupervised LDA on all the social graph edge sets followed by supervised classification on the labeled subset (via Vowpal Wabbit) achieves 72% accuracy.  Note that 72% accuracy is no straw man: this is the best result from an array of experiments where I varied the number of topics and other parameters in the LDA model. <br /><br />My intuition was that supervised LDA on the labeled subset would not do as well as unsupervised LDA on the entire set followed by supervised classification on the labeled subset, because the latter technique uses all the data.  Now I have to update my intuitions!<br /><br /><h4>Semi-Supervised Results</h4>Unfortunately the situation goes south when I add unsupervised data.  Here's a plot of accuracy on a test set as a function of the fraction of training data which was unlabeled.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JIQaneZVmlk/TbSoE8TV01I/AAAAAAAAAME/y6TKF3SYyhc/s1600/plot-accbyfraction.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="300" width="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JIQaneZVmlk/TbSoE8TV01I/AAAAAAAAAME/y6TKF3SYyhc/s400/plot-accbyfraction.png" /></a></div>This is unfortunate, because I'd like to take the x-axis in this plot to 0.99 (i.e., only 1% of my overall data is labeled) and the trend is not my friend.<br /><br />There is still a lot of tuning and bug finding so I'm not necessarily sunk.  However there is no nice theoretical result driving things either: I'm not aware of any guarantees of classification improvement due to adding unsupervised data to a classifier based upon a generative model, especially when the generative model is known to be incorrect (i.e., documents are not actually generated this way).  So at some point, I'll have to raise the white flag.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4446292666398344382-685249501339395141?l=www.machinedlearnings.com' alt='' /></div></div>

<p>With barely a week left in the 12-week Deloitte/FIDE Chess Rating Challenge, it is still very unclear who is going to finish atop the final standings and claim the $10,000 main prize, provided by the contest&#8217;s sponsor: Deloitte Australia.  We have seen a very close struggle so far, with six different teams spending at least 5 days in first place, and some recent advances ought to lead to a very interesting final week.</p>

<p>The contest has been designed to identify the most accurate rating system to predict the results of chess games, using a training dataset of more than 1.84 million chess games from a recent 11-year period.  Participants train their rating systems using the training dataset, and then use their system to predict the results of a further 100,000 games played during the three months immediately following the training period.</p>
<p>The scoring function is a variation on the log likelihood, known as the Binomial Deviance.  This measure is on the log(probability) scale, so converting it back to the probability scale allows us to measure the proportion of correct predictions made by each entry, one possible way to measure accuracy.  A &#8220;null rating system&#8221;, one which predicts a 50-50 outcome in every single game, would have an accuracy of 50%, whereas the Elo system (the most widely-used rating system in the chess world) has an accuracy of 55%.  Therefore anyone who can reach an accuracy of 56% could reasonably claim to be a 20% improvement upon the Elo system.</p>
<p>At the start of the contest, I calculated and submitted several benchmark systems, representing implementations of publicly-documented approaches (including Elo and alternative systems) that would allow participants to measure their progress.  The two most accurate benchmarks were the Glicko system (4.8% better than Elo) and the Chessmetrics system (7.1% better than Elo).  As organizer of the contest, I thought that a fairly aggressive goal for the contest would be for at least one participant to reach 15% better than Elo (which would be a Binomial Deviance of 0.253672 or better).  That sets the stage for the beginning of the contest:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp11.png" rel="lightbox[996]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006" title="chessp1" src="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp11.png" alt="" width="460" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>It is worth mentioning here that this is the second such Kaggle contest for predicting chess outcomes.  In the fall of 2010 a similar contest was held on a much smaller contest (at least in terms of data; that contest had less than 5% as much data as this contest does).  I encouraged the top finishers from that contest to participate early on in this one, if only to run their algorithms on the larger data set to provide additional benchmarking.  And in fact, five of the top-ten finishers from that first contest (Outis, pug, Diogo, UriB, and uqwn) are in the top twenty in this second contest as well.  These participants had an early advantage on the rest of the field, and so the first couple weeks of the contest were mostly dominated by them.  But by the end of the third week, two new participants (Shang Tsung and PragmaticTheory) had already passed by the top finishers from the previous contest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp2.png" rel="lightbox[996]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-998" title="chessp2" src="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp2.png" alt="" width="460" height="246" /></a></p>
<p>Please note that all of these graphs represent public leaderboard scores; we reveal nothing about the private scores until after the contest.  On the public leaderboard, you can see that after only three weeks, already six different teams had reached the &#8220;10% better than Elo&#8221; level, and it appeared likely that the 15% contest goal would indeed be reached by someone.  With no real idea what the future would hold, I remember being disappointed 1.4 weeks into the contest, seeing that PragmaticTheory had opened such a large lead on the field!  I remembered from the first contest how Outis had reached the overall best score during the first few weeks, and held the private #1 spot throughout the last two months.  I didn&#8217;t want to see that type of finish again!  Of course, I needn&#8217;t have worried; you can see that the lead changed hands several times and there was no evidence yet of anyone pulling away for good.  Now let&#8217;s jump ahead two more weeks:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp3.png" rel="lightbox[996]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999" title="chessp3" src="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp3.png" alt="" width="460" height="246" /></a></p>
<p>You can see that after 5 weeks, it was clear that at least one participant, and probably two, would surpass the &#8220;15% better than Elo&#8221; goal that I had envisioned for the contest.  However there was a &#8220;plateau&#8221; effect that we have seen on many Kaggle contests, where the progress levels off and it becomes very difficult to squeeze any more accuracy out of the data.  Although the top two spots were held by a different pair of teams this time (Uri Blass and Balazs), there was already some evidence that participants were beginning to level off a bit, and we legitimately wondered whether anyone would do much better over the remaining 7 weeks of the contest.  Well, once again, we needn&#8217;t have worried.  Look what happened over just the next two weeks…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp4.png" rel="lightbox[996]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000" title="chessp4" src="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp4.png" alt="" width="460" height="246" /></a></p>
<p>Although the previous top two (Uri Blass and Balazs) were indeed leveling off, three different teams (Tim Salimans, Shang Tsung, and PlanetThanet) made tremendous strides and blasted straight through the 20% level without hardly slowing down at all.  With several incredible breakthroughs of accuracy, Tim Salimans was well ahead of even the #2 and #3 spots, and was also the first to score a public Binomial Deviance lower than 0.25 (representing a 24.5% improvement on Elo).  Once the contest is over, I definitely want to hear what happened during these two weeks, what the breakthroughs actually were and whether the teams achieved these improvements independently or not.  It was quite a couple of weeks!  And once again, you could legitimately think that the #1 spot would be retained for the rest of the contest, especially given the huge lead after seven weeks.  Or you could have thought that the experience of the first seven weeks showed that no lead was safe&#8230;  Let&#8217;s go forward in time by two more weeks:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp5.png" rel="lightbox[996]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001" title="chessp5" src="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp5.png" alt="" width="460" height="246" /></a></p>
<p>After nine weeks were completed, Tim Salimans still had a nice lead and it seemed quite likely that he could coast to the finish with only marginal improvements, probably followed by PlanetThanet in second place.  There were several people creeping up to the 15% level, but all of them seemed to be leveling off and perhaps not too much of a threat to the leaders.  Well, again a whole lot can change in just two weeks.  Let&#8217;s go ahead one more jump, two weeks forward into the present:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp6.png" rel="lightbox[996]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002" title="chessp6" src="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp6.png" alt="" width="460" height="246" /></a></p>
<p>With amazingly steady progress, team PlanetThanet has finally overtaken Tim Salimans, and team uqwn had an incredible leap forward, another powerful insight or technical improvement, or who knows what &#8211; but I hope we can find out after the contest is over!  I am tempted to say it seems very likely that one of those top three will indeed finish at the top of the public leaderboard, but as we have seen previously, a lot can happen in just a couple of days, and there is still room for big breakthroughs!  One more interesting graph shows us the progress of the leading score at various points in the contest.  Previous Kaggle contests would lead us to expect the progress to slow done some, and I guess it has slowed down, but it definitely hasn&#8217;t stopped yet:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp7.png" rel="lightbox[996]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003" title="chessp7" src="http://blog.kaggle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/chessp7.png" alt="" width="460" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure we are all looking forward to hearing everyone&#8217;s experiences throughout the contest, and I hope lots of people will be willing to share their thoughts, even those who ultimately don&#8217;t win a prize.  Sad to say, the contest ends on Wednesday, May 4, at 3pm UTC &#8211; keep your eyes on the leaderboard and don&#8217;t be surprised if there further new developments before we reach the end!  And remember that the winners will need to document their approaches in order to qualify for the prizes, and we will certainly be sharing writeups from the leaders (and anyone else with useful insight) on this blog after the contest concludes.</p>
<p>By the way, for anyone interested in mapping from their Binomial Deviance score to the &#8220;% better than Elo&#8221; scale, you take POWER(10.0, -BinomialDeviance), and this gives you your &#8220;accuracy&#8221;.  This calculation yields an accuracy of exactly 50% for the All Draws Benchmark, and almost exactly 55% for the Actual FIDE Ratings Benchmark or the Optimized Elo Benchmark. And so the &#8220;% better than Elo&#8221; measure is just how much better than 55% accuracy you had, divided by the difference between the Elo accuracy (55%) and the &#8220;null rating system&#8221; accuracy (50%).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>M</strong>ichael Evans and Gun Ho Jang posted an <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3258">arXiv paper</a> where they discuss the connection between MAP, least relative surprise (or maximum profile likelihood) estimators, and loss functions. I posted a while ago <a title="MAP estimators are not truly Bayesian estimators" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/map-estimators-are-not-truly-bayesian-estimators/">my perspective</a> on MAP estimators, followed by <a title="MAP estimators (cont’d)" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/map-estimators-contd/">several comments</a> on the Bayesian nature of those estimators, hence will not reproduce them here, but the core of the matter is that neither MAP estimators, nor MLEs are really justified by a decision-theoretic approach, at least in a continuous parameter space. And that the dominating measure<em> [arbitrarily]</em> chosen on the parameter space impacts the value of the MAP, as demonstrated by <a href="http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2007/vol02/issue04/druilhet.pdf">Druihlet and Marin</a> in 2007.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-10089"></span><strong>E</strong>vans and Jang start in the finite case with the loss function</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BL%7D%28%5Ctheta%2Cd%29+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BI%7D%5C%7B%5CPsi%28%5Ctheta%29+%5Cne+d%29+%2F+%5Cpi_%5CPsi%28%5CPsi%28%5Ctheta%29%29&amp;bg=000000&amp;fg=B0B0B0&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;mathrm{L}(&#92;theta,d) = &#92;mathbb{I}&#92;{&#92;Psi(&#92;theta) &#92;ne d) / &#92;pi_&#92;Psi(&#92;Psi(&#92;theta))' title='&#92;mathrm{L}(&#92;theta,d) = &#92;mathbb{I}&#92;{&#92;Psi(&#92;theta) &#92;ne d) / &#92;pi_&#92;Psi(&#92;Psi(&#92;theta))' class='latex' /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">where they consider the estimation of the transform <em>Ψ(θ)</em> by <em>d</em>, inversely weighted by the marginal prior on this transform. In the special case of the identity transform, this loss function leads to the MLE as the Bayes estimator. In the general case, the Bayes estimator is the maximum profile likelihood estimator (LRSE). However, this loss function does not generalise to countably infinite (and obviously continuous) parameter spaces and in such settings the authors can only provide LRSEs as limits of Bayes procedures. The loss function adopted in the countable case is for instance</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BL%7D%28%5Ctheta%2Cd%29+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BI%7D%5C%7B%5CPsi%28%5Ctheta%29+%5Cne+d%5C%7D+%2F+%5Cmax%5C%7B%5Ceta%2C%5Cpi_%5CPsi%28%5CPsi%28%5Ctheta%29%29%5C%7D&amp;bg=000000&amp;fg=B0B0B0&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;mathrm{L}(&#92;theta,d) = &#92;mathbb{I}&#92;{&#92;Psi(&#92;theta) &#92;ne d&#92;} / &#92;max&#92;{&#92;eta,&#92;pi_&#92;Psi(&#92;Psi(&#92;theta))&#92;}' title='&#92;mathrm{L}(&#92;theta,d) = &#92;mathbb{I}&#92;{&#92;Psi(&#92;theta) &#92;ne d&#92;} / &#92;max&#92;{&#92;eta,&#92;pi_&#92;Psi(&#92;Psi(&#92;theta))&#92;}' class='latex' /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">with the bound decreasing to zero. In the continuous case, the indicator does not work any longer, thus the choice made by the authors is to discretise the space <em>Ψ(Θ)</em> by a specific choice of a partition of balls whose diameters <em>λ</em> go to zero. In the spirit of <a href="http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2007/vol02/issue04/druilhet.pdf">Druihlet and Marin</a>, this choice depends on a metric (and further regularity conditions). Furthermore, the LRSE itself</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmax_%7B%5Cpsi%7D%5Cpi_%5Cpsi%28%5Cpsi%7Cx%29%2F%5Cpi_%5Cpsi%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=000000&amp;fg=B0B0B0&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;max_{&#92;psi}&#92;pi_&#92;psi(&#92;psi|x)/&#92;pi_&#92;psi(&#92;theta)' title='&#92;max_{&#92;psi}&#92;pi_&#92;psi(&#92;psi|x)/&#92;pi_&#92;psi(&#92;theta)' class='latex' /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">does depend on the version chosen for the densities (if not on the dominating measure), unless one imposes everywhere the Bayes equality</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_%7B%5Cpsi%7D%28%5Cpsi%7Cx%29%2F%5Cpi_%5Cpsi%28%5Ctheta%29%3Df%28x%7C%5Cpsi%29%2Fm%28x%29&amp;bg=000000&amp;fg=B0B0B0&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;pi_{&#92;psi}(&#92;psi|x)/&#92;pi_&#92;psi(&#92;theta)=f(x|&#92;psi)/m(x)' title='&#92;pi_{&#92;psi}(&#92;psi|x)/&#92;pi_&#92;psi(&#92;theta)=f(x|&#92;psi)/m(x)' class='latex' /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">everywhere, when</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">in the spirit of our <a title="Savage-Dickey published" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/savage-dickey-published/">Savage-Dickey paradox</a> paper. In conclusion, while I do appreciate the effort to embed both MAP and [profile] likelihood estimators within a Bayesian decision-theoretic setting, the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3258">paper</a> does not really validate those, in the sense that limits of Bayes estimators are not necessarily optimal.</p>

<p><a href="http://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/amazon_price.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1433" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="amazon_price" src="http://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/amazon_price.jpg" alt="900,000,000 book" width="292" height="229" /></a>The Twitterverse is giggling over some of the absurd pricing for some used books at Amazon (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ipeirotis">Panos Ipeirotis</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/golan">Golan Levin</a> were two  who tweeted on the subject).  There are books at Amazon where the price is in the millions of dollars!  How can such a thing happen?</p>
<p>While I love the picture of an eager seller (&#8220;I have just two books for sale, but, man, if I sell one, I am set for life!&#8221;), the explanation is much more mundane, at least in some cases.  As the <a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=358">&#8220;it is NOT junk&#8221; blog shows</a>, it is clear that two sellers of the book <em>The Making of a Fly</em> (a snip at a price height of a mere $23 million) are setting their price relative to each others price.  Seller A sets its price equal to .99830 times that of seller B;  B sets its equal to 1.27059 of A.  Every day the price of the book goes up by a factor of 1.26843.  Do this for a few months, and you&#8217;ll get prices in the millions.</p>
<p>This sort of market driven pricing is not unreasonable.  Sellers with good reputation are able to command higher prices (see, for instance, <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~panos/research.html">the paper by Ghosth, Ipeirotis, and Sundararajan</a> on &#8220;Reputation Premiums in Electronic Peer-to-Peer Markets&#8221; for results and references).  A firm might well feel that its reputation is worth a premium of 27.059%.  Another firm might adopt an alternative strategy of just undercutting the competition by, say .0017%.  Everything works fine until they become the only two firms in a market.  Then the exponential growth in prices appears since there is no real &#8220;market&#8221; to base their differential on.</p>
<p>Such an issue would be nothing more than an amusing sideline if it weren&#8217;t for the effect such algorithmic prices can have on more important issues than obscure used books.  The &#8220;flash crash&#8221; of the stock market in 2010 <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/flash-crash-cause-found">appears to have been caused</a> by the interaction between one large sale and automated systems that executed trades based on trading volumes, not price.  As the SEC report states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230; under stressed market conditions, the automated execution of a large sell order can trigger extreme price movements, especially if the automated execution algorithm does not take prices into account. Moreover, the interaction between automated execution programs and algorithmic trading strategies can quickly erode liquidity and result in disorderly markets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Pricing based on markets abound.  At the recent<a href="http://meetings2.informs.org/Analytics2011/edelman.html"> Edelman competition</a>, one of the groups (InterContinental Hotels Group) discussed a price-setting mechanism that had, as one of the inputs, the competing prices in the area.  Fortunately, they had a &#8220;human in the loop&#8221; that prevents spiraling prices of the form seen at Amazon.</p>
<p>In a wish to be quick, there is great pressure to move to automated pricing.  Until we create systems that are more robust to unforeseen situations, we risk having not just $900,000,000 books, but all sorts of &#8220;transient&#8221; effects when systems spin out of control.  And these effects can cause tremendous damage in a short period of time.</p>

</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Here is another thought provoking item along the lines of the recent entry <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2011/04/can-compressive-sensing-help-mapping.html">Can Compressive Sensing Help the Mapping of Brain Networks ?</a> A while back, I made the case that in the audio business there was not probably a good reason as to why somebody would want to look at changing the recording hardware as you can already get some very high quality ones and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Bottle-Microphone-System/dp/B001ESFN40?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nuitblan-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969">even expensive ones</a>. I also wondered <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2010/05/cs-around-blogs-in-80-hours-part-deux.html">what sort of niche market</a> would enable a <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2010/10/cs-compressive-mutliplexer-for-multi.html">different sort of microphone</a> that does not just record voice but does something else. Here is the beginning of an answer, a microphone that also does imaging. Here is the first attempt at answering that question:&nbsp;<a href="http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/163240/files/canyouhear.pdf?version=4">Can One Hear the Shape of a Room: The 2-D Polygonal Case</a> by <a href="http://people.epfl.ch/ivan.dokmanic">Ivan Dokmanic</a>, <a href="http://lu.seas.harvard.edu/">Yue M. Lu</a> and <a href="http://lcav.epfl.ch/people/martin.vetterli/">Martin Vetterli</a>. The abstract reads:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">We consider the problem of estimating room geometry from the acoustic room impulse response (RIR). Existing attacks on this problem exploit the knowledge of multiple RIRs. In contrast, we are interested in reconstructing the room geometry from a single RIR — a 1–D function of time. We discuss the unicity of the mapping between the geometry of a planar polygonal room and a single RIR. In addition to this theoretical analysis, we also propose an algorithm that performs the “blindfolded” room estimation. Furthermore, the derived results are used to construct an algorithm for localization in a known room using only a single RIR. Veriﬁcation of the theoretical developments with numerical simulations is given before concluding the paper.</div></blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><!-- Site Meter XHTML Strict 1.0 -->

• <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/fomc-preview.html">FOMC Preview</a><br />
<br />
The key economic report for the coming week is the Q1 advance GDP report to be released on Thursday. There are also two important housing reports to be released early in the week: New Home sales on Monday and Case-Shiller house prices on Tuesday. The FOMC will hold a 2 day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a press briefing on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
<center><b>----- Monday, April 25th -----</b></center><br />
10:00 AM: <b>New Home Sales</b> for March from the Census Bureau. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?New-Home#category=New-Home&amp;chart=NHSFeb2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1130,height=780,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="New Home Sales and Recessions" border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uJ1_00XE0_Y/TYn_VFVnwxI/AAAAAAAAKDc/JEGhZN-e-l0/s320/NHSFeb2011.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a><i><b><span style="font-size: 85%;">Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.</span></b></i><br />
<br />
This graph shows New Home Sales since 1963. The dashed line is the current sales rate.<br />
<br />
The consensus is for an increase in sales to 280 thousand Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR) in March from a record low 250 thousand in February. <br />
<br />
10:30 AM: <b>Dallas Fed Manufacturing Survey</b> for April. The Texas production index increased to 24.1 in March, its highest level in nearly a year (from 10.0 in February).<br />
<br />
<center><b>----- Tuesday, April 26th -----</b></center><br />
9:00 AM: <b>S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index</b> for February. Although this is the February report, it is really a 3 month average of December, January and February. The consensus is for prices to decline about 0.4% in February; the eight straight month of house price declines. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Home-Prices#category=Home-Prices&amp;chart=CSJan2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1080,height=760,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Case-Shiller House Prices Indices" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xiJVD-Xl9vU/TZHaV2XTJdI/AAAAAAAAKE4/u5D3PBcv_cg/s320/CSJan2011.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> This graph shows the seasonally adjusted Composite 10 and Composite 20 indices through January (the Composite 20 was started in January 2000).<br />
<br />
Prices are falling again, although still above the lows set in early 2009. The Composite 20 index should be close to the post-bubble low in February.<br />
<br />
10:00 AM: <b>Richmond Fed Survey of Manufacturing Activity</b> for April. The consensus is for the index to be at 20, the same as in March (above zero is expansion). <br />
<br />
10:00 AM: <b>Conference Board's consumer confidence index</b> for April. The consensus is for an increase to 64.4 from 63.4 last month.<br />
<br />
<center><b>----- Wednesday, April 27th -----</b></center><br />
7:00 AM: The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) will release the <b>mortgage purchase applications index</b>. This index has increased slightly in recent weeks, but is still at 1997 levels.<br />
<br />
8:30 AM: <b>Durable Goods Orders</b> for March from the Census Bureau. The consensus is for a 2.0% increase in durable goods orders after decreasing 0.9% in February.<br />
<br />
10:00 AM: <b>Q1 Housing Vacancies and Homeownership</b> report from the Census Bureau. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Housing#category=Housing&amp;chart=HomeownershipRateQ42010.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1040,height=800,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Homeownership Rate" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pMscxxELHEg/TUbPtaWdhtI/AAAAAAAAJ24/aSlILJGpcPk/s320/HomeownershipRateQ42010.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float: left; margin: 10px;" /></a> The homeownership rate was at 66.5% in Q4 2010, down from 66.9% in Q3. This is at about the level as 1998.<br />
<br />
The homeownership rate peaked at 69.2% in Q4 2004.<br />
<br />
Also important are the homeowner and rental vacancy rates.<br />
<br />
12:30PM: <b>FOMC Meeting Announcement</b>. No changes are expected to either interest rates or QE2.<br />
<br />
2:15 PM: <b>Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke</b> holds press briefing on FOMC meeting. Here is a <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/fomc-preview.html">preview</a> of the FOMC meeting.<br />
<br />
<center><b>----- Thursday, April 28th -----</b></center><br />
8:30 AM: The <b>initial weekly unemployment claims</b> report will be released. The number of initial claims has been trending down over the last few months, however initial claims increased to over 400 thousand for the last two weeks. The consensus is for a decrease to 390 thousand compared to 403 thousand last week. <br />
<br />
8:30 AM: <b>Q1 GDP (advance release)</b>. This is the advance release from the BEA.  <br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?GDP#category=GDP&chart=Q1GDPForecast.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1130,height=770,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="GDP Growth Rate" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HH5MfhiE9_s/TbOHTWGVfHI/AAAAAAAAKLQ/TnDuXkrsCHM/s320/Q1GDPForecast.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> This graph shows the quarterly GDP growth (at an annual rate) for the last 30 years.  <br />
<br />
The consensus is that real GDP increased 1.8% annualized in Q1.  The estimate for Q1 is in blue.<br />
<br />
The dashed line is the median growth rate of 3.05%.  <br />
<br />
8:30 AM ET: <b>Chicago Fed National Activity Index</b> (March). This is a composite index of other data.<br />
<br />
10:00 AM: <b>Pending Home Sales Index</b> for March. The consensus is for a 1.5% increase in contracts signed. It usually takes 45 to 60 days to close, so this will provide an early indication of closings in April.<br />
<br />
11:00 AM: <b>Kansas City Fed regional Manufacturing Survey</b> for April. The index was at a record 27 in March.<br />
<br />
<center><b>----- Friday, April 29th -----</b></center><br />
8:30 AM: <b>Personal Income and Outlays</b> for March. The consensus is for a 0.4% increase in personal income and a 0.5% increase in personal spending, and for the Core PCE price index to increase 0.1%.<br />
<br />
9:45 AM: <b>Chicago Purchasing Managers Index</b> for April. The consensus is for a slight decrease to a still very strong 69.2 (down from 70.6 in March). <br />
<br />
9:55 AM: <b>Reuter's/University of Michigan's Consumer sentiment index</b> (final for April). The consensus is for an increase to 70.0 from the preliminary reading of 69.6.<br />
<br />
12:30 PM: <b>Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke</b> speaks, "<i>Community Development in Challenging Times</i>" in Arlington, Virginia<br />

<div>Content:
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>The guest post below comes from someone concerned about the move for 'public authority' for UW-Madison.<br /><br />The politics of public authority for UW-Madison seem to be unraveling. People who’re talking to key Republican lawmakers and their staffers are hearing things like “non-starter”, “no way” and “ain’t gonna happen”. The Chancellor has ginned up a lot of support on campus and in Madison, but statewide politics will likely kill this proposal.<br /><br />But this deal is a monster and a lot of monsters don’t die easy. Let me give you a silver bullet for your pistol in case you meet the monster in a dark alley: This deal with Walker has been sold around vague flexibilities. The details we know, in fact, are mostly serious downsides, and many people aren’t even aware of them. Consider the budget implications of these two tidbits, one you may and one you may not know:<br /><blockquote>(1) In previous budget cuts, we’ve taken 40% of the total cut to UW-System, but this cut is 50-50 between us and System. That’s an extra $30 million base cut annually. No projected gains from flexibilities shows how that amount could be made up. The projections shown at the Faculty Senate and elsewhere basically conceal this fact: They project our budget as if it were starting from where we are now, not from $30 million less. How long would it take to recoup that amount in the base budget?<br /><br />(2) We would no longer have a state pay plan. That means that our block grant would in the future not include any money for pay increases. Any. Ever. As salaries increase, we’d have to cover that from our own new monies. A 1% raise for the whole campus costs about $5 million right now, with benefits. So, a modest 3% raise would mean generating an extra $15 million per year in perpetuity. Chart that out over 10 years on a spreadsheet!</blockquote>Bottom line, the current proposal guarantees us cuts, far deeper than if we stay with System.<br /><br />Worse, there is not any of feigned promise of insurance of any kind against future cuts. The Virginia model contained the kinds of guarantees that Wisconsin’s proposal lacks. And the legislature still came back and cut them further.<br /><br />There’s a real way forward here, one the legislature and the System may be willing to pursue: Much of the flexibility that people argue for — and much of which would be uncontroversially useful to our campus — can be achieved without public authority. And without the extremely damaging consequences outlined above.  We need a concrete set of flexibilities that we can agree on, which will work for us within System and which the legislature can accept.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33159158-2096286640586733790?l=mr-verb.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></div>

<a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/5/107695-technology-has-social-consequences/fulltext">Technology Has Social Consequences | May 2011 | Communications of the ACM</a>: <cite>The loss in quality of conference reviewing is just one result of the move to virtual PC meetings. Another outcome is the loss of socialization that took place in PC meetings. It is this lost socialization that contributed to a senior researcher being ignorant of one of the most basic rules of scholarly reviewing.</cite><p>I quoted the paragraph in Moshe's article that best summarizes his main point. The article is worth reading in full. However, I disagree with both its alleged empirical claims and its main argument. Moshe claims that reviewing quality is down in CS conferences, and reviewers are less aware of good scholarly conduct. However, he provides no empirical evidence for these claims except for one anecdote and some vague impressions, which I could easily counter with old tales of reviewing incompetence and malice. He then proceeds to argue that those failings are the result of less face-to-face interaction among reviewers. Again, he provides no empirical evidence for the claim, and he does not consider alternative explanations. In particular, he does not consider the fact that many areas of CS have grown rapidly. For example, I just did a simple calculation to arrive at an estimate that computational linguistics as a field has grown at an average 6%/year over the last 28 years, making the field <strong>five</strong> times as big now as when I presented my first ACL paper. This growth forced conferences to adopt more complex structures, with areas, multiple tiers, electronic submission and review discussion, simply to scale up to the much larger population. We can argue about the specifics of reviewing mechanisms, but the old unitary program committee was already collapsing under the strain around 15 years ago for the first-tier conferences I have been involved in.</p><p>But there's an even bigger potential problem that Moshe does not discuss. As the field has matured, it takes longer and it is harder for someone to become a good reviewer because there's just more to know. Meanwhile, the number of people coming into the field continues to grow and the number of papers submitted grows in proportion. The result is then that the ratio of submissions to qualified reviewers increases. Less qualified reviewers are enrolled, or qualified reviewers are overloaded. Either way, review quality goes down. For all we know, it is this, and not Web-based program committees, that is the root cause of all the complaining about bad reviewing in the last few years.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6916168470376937425-3898573254185484650?l=earningmyturns.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></div>

<div>Description: </div>
<div>Content:
There will be a two day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) this coming Tuesday and Wednesday. I expect no changes to the Fed Funds rate, or to the program to reinvest principal payments, or to the Large Scale Asset Purchase program (LSAP, aka "QE2").<br />
<br />
Some things to look for:<br />
<br />
<b>1) Fed Chairman Press Briefing.</b> This will be the first FOMC statement followed by a <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110324a.htm">press briefing</a> with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. <br />
<br />
The FOMC statement will be released earlier than usual - around 12:30 PM ET on Wednesday, and the Chairman's press briefing will be held at 2:15 PM.<br />
<br />
At the press briefing, Chairman Bernanke is expected to discuss the new FOMC forecasts (usually these have been released a few weeks later with the minutes of the meeting). Growth forecasts have probably been revised down since January, the unemployment rate revised down, and inflation forecasts revised up. Here is a table of the January (and November) forecasts for reference:<br />
<br />
<center><table border="2" cellpadding="4" style="width: 600px;"><colgroup></colgroup><colgroup align="center"></colgroup><colgroup align="center"></colgroup><colgroup align="center"></colgroup><colgroup align="center"></colgroup><tbody>
<tr><th colspan="4">January 2011 Economic projections of Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank presidents</th></tr>
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr>
<tr><th>Change in Real GDP</th><td>3.4 to 3.9</td><td>3.5 to 4.4</td><td>3.7 to 4.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Previous Projection (Nov 2010)</td><td>3.0 to 3.6</td><td>3.6 to 4.5</td><td>3.5 to 4.6</td></tr>
<tr><th>Unemployment Rate </th><td>8.8 to 9.0</td><td>7.6 to 8.1</td><td>6.8 to 7.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Previous Projection (Nov 2010)</td><td>8.9 to 9.1</td><td>7.7 to 8.2</td><td>6.9 to 7.4</td></tr>
<tr><th>PCE Inflaton</th><td>1.3 to 1.7</td><td>1.0 to 1.9</td><td>1.2 to 2.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Previous Projection (Nov 2010)</td><td>1.1 to 1.7</td><td>1.1 to 1.8</td><td>1.2 to 2.0</td></tr>
<tr><th>Core PCE Inflation</th><td>1.0 to 1.3</td><td>1.0 to 1.5</td><td>1.2 to 2.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Previous Projection (Nov 2010)</td><td>0.9 to 1.6</td><td>1.0 to 1.6</td><td>1.1 to 2.0</td></tr>
</tbody></table></center><br />
FOMC definitions:<br />
<sup>1</sup> Projections of change in real GDP and in inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.<br />
<sup>2</sup> Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.<br />
<br />
<b>2) Possible Statement Changes.</b> I don't expect the key sentence "likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period" to be changed any time soon. <br />
<br />
There might be some minor changes to the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110315a.htm">first paragraph</a> to mention the recent softer economic data - and also slightly stronger employment data. Also the FOMC statement will continue to note that "measures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low", but they will probably note the recent pickup in inflation - and also say the increase is expected to be transitory.<br />
<br />
<b>3) Timeline for Fed tightening</b> It appears QE2 will end in June as scheduled with no tapering of purchases. It also appears the Fed will <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-19/bernanke-may-reinvest-maturing-debt-to-avoid-cold-turkey-end-to-stimulus.html">continue to reinvestment</a> maturing securities - at least for a couple of months following the end of QE2. <br />
<br />
This suggests a timeline for the <i>earliest</i> Fed funds rate increase:<br />
• End of QE2 in June.<br />
• End of reinvestment 2+ months later.<br />
• Drop extended period language a couple months later<br />
• Raise rates in early to mid-2012.<br />
<br />
That is probably the <i>earliest</i> the Fed would raise rates - and it could be much later.<br />

<p>The new issue of <em>American Scientist</em> is out, both on newsstands and <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.90/past.aspx">on the web</a>. My <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/3/bit-lit">&#8220;Computing Science&#8221; column</a> takes up a topic I&#8217;ve already written about here on bit-player: the huge corpus of &#8220;<em>n</em>-grams&#8221; extracted from the Google Books scanning project and released to the public by a team from Harvard and Google. (The earlier bit-player items are titled <a href="http://bit-player.org/2010/googling-the-lexicon">&#8220;Googling the Lexicon&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://bit-player.org/2011/314">&#8220;3.14.&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p>After two blog posts and a magazine column, my faithful readers may have had enough of this subject&#8212;but not me. I can&#8217;t seem to get it out of my system. So I&#8217;m going to take this opportunity to publish some of the overflow matter that wouldn&#8217;t fit in the column. (And even this won&#8217;t be the end of the story. Stay tuned for still more <em>n</em>-grams.)</p>
<p>For the benefit of readers who have <em>not</em> been doting on my every word, here&#8217;s a precis. Google aims to digitize all the world&#8217;s printed books, and so far they have scanned about 15 million volumes (which is probably about one-eighth of the total). At Harvard, Erez Lieberman Aiden and Jean-Baptiste Michel, with a dozen collaborators, have been working with digitized text from a subset of 5,195,769 Google book scans. Because of copyright restrictions they cannot release the full text, but they have extracted lists of <em>n</em>-grams, or phrases of <em>n</em> words each, for values of <em>n</em> between 1 and 5. The 1-grams are individual words (or other character strings, such as numbers and punctuation marks); the 2-grams are two-word phrases, and so on. Each <em>n</em>-gram is accompanied by a time series giving the number of occurrences of that <em>n</em>-gram in each year from 1520 to 2008. (For more background and technical detail, see the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2010/12/15/science.1199644"><em>Science</em> article</a> by Michel, et al.)</p>
<p>If you want to trace changes in the frequency of a specific word over time, Google has set up an online <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/">Ngram Viewer</a> that makes this easy. But you can also <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/datasets">download</a> the data set, which allows for many other kinds of exploration. The cost is some heavy lifting of multigigabyte files. So far I have worked only with English text (six other languages are also covered) and only with 1-grams, which form the smallest part of the data set.</p>
<p>Here are some basic facts and figures on the English 1-grams:</p>
<table cellpadding="5" width="400" align="center" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">uncompressed file size (bytes)</td>
<td align="right">9,672,200,350</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">number of distinct 1-grams</td>
<td align="right">7,380,256</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">total 1-gram occurrences</td>
<td align="right">359,675,008,445</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">number of distinct character codes</td>
<td align="right">484</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">total character occurrences</td>
<td align="right">1,515,454,264,550</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of verbiage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth pausing for a comment on those 484 distinct character codes. We tend to think of English as being written with an alphabet of just 26 letters, or 52 if you count upper case and lower case separately. Then there are numbers and marks of punctuation, and miscellaneous symbols such as $ and +. The original ASCII code had 95 printable characters. How do you get up to 484? Well, even though these files are derived from English-language books, a fair amount of non-English turns up in them. There&#8217;s Greek and Cyrillic and a smattering of Asian languages, as well as all the accented versions of Latin characters seen in Romance and Germanic and Slavic languages. There&#8217;s even a little mathematical notation. It&#8217;s actually surprising that the data set spans <em>only</em> 484 symbols; this is a small subset of the full Unicode spectrum.</p>
<p>Here is the length distribution of the 7 million distinct 1-grams:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/word-lengths-of-types-1-to-20.png" border="0" alt="graph of abundance vs. word length for the 7 million distinct 1-grams" width="450" height="277" /></p>
<p>Note that the abundance of shorter words is combinatorially limited. With an &#8220;alphabet&#8221; of 484 symbols, there cannot possibly be more than 484 single-character words, or 484<sup>2</sup> two-character words. But this constraint becomes unimportant beyond length 3; for words of five or six letters, only a tiny fraction of all possible combinations are actually observed.</p>
<p>The corresponding distribution for the 359 billion word occurrences looks rather different:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/word-lengths-of-tokens-1-to-20.png" alt="graph of abundance vs. word length for the 359 billion word occurrences" border="0" width="450" height="291" /></p>
<p>This is roughly what you&#8217;d expect to see for a language that encodes information efficiently. As in a Huffman coding, the shortest words are very common, and the sesquipedalian ones are rare. The overall trend is generally linear, and it is remarkably so in the range of lengths from 5 to 11 or 12. Is this a well-known fact? (It is <em>not</em> the shape I would have guessed.) Words of length three and four stand out above the linear trend line. And I should mention that the abundance of single-character words is boosted in this tabulation by the inclusion of punctuation marks, which would probably not be counted at all in other studies of word length.</p>
<p>The graph below is one that appears in my <em>American Scientist</em> column. I reproduce it here because I want to call attention to some curious features of the curves.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2011-05-ngrams-f2-tokens-and-types.png" alt="historical time series of distinct words and word occurrences" border="0" width="450" height="307" /></p>
<p>The graph shows the number of distinct words per year <em>(blue)</em> and the total word occurrences per year <em>(red)</em> over the past 200 years or so. I find it interesting that some major historical events are visible in this record. There are dips in both curves at the time of the American Civil War and during both World Wars of the 20th century. Presumably, book publishing languished during those years. There are also ripples that might be attributed to the crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression, although they are less clear.</p>
<p>Other features of the curves don&#8217;t have such a ready-made historical explanation. I am particularly curious about the broad sag in the red curve (but not the blue one) from the late 1960s through the 1970s. Between 1967 and 1973, the number of word occurrences declined 12 percent, while the number of distinct words rose 1 percent. This is very strange: We continued to invent new words, but we didn&#8217;t make much use of them. Nowhere else do the two curves maintain opposite slopes for any extended period. I can&#8217;t explain it. I call it the great Nixonian slump.</p>
<p>I thought I might learn something about the slump by looking at a selection of specific words that exhibit this pattern of abundance&#8212;less frequent in the early 70s than in surrounding years. So I extracted about 70,000 of them and sorted them by overall abundance. In many ways it&#8217;s an interesting collection. At the very top of the list is <em>Reagan,</em> apparently in eclipse during the Nixon years. Then there&#8217;s a swarm of words connected with mechanical and automotive engineering: <em>torque, rotor, stator, pinion, crankshaft, impeller, carburetor, alternator</em>. All of these words might plausibly appear in the same books, so seeing them fade in and out together is not so surprising. Still, one would like to know what happened in book publishing to cause the decline. The 70s were a tough time for the auto industry; is that enough to explain it?</p>
<p>Looking for patterns in these words is fun, but the truth is I don&#8217;t believe they have anything to do with the overall Nixonian swoon.  Most words have large fluctuations in abundance over a time scale of a decade or two; my extraction procedure merely identified a subset of words that happened to enter a trough at the same time. I could find similar sets for other periods.</p>
<p>In another attempt to explain the slump I divided the data set into halves. One half consists of the 100 most frequent words, which happen to account for almost exactly half of all word occurrences. The other 7,380,156 words make up the second half. Maybe the slump afflicted only common words, or only rare ones? The result was remarkably uninformative:</p>
<p><img class="centered" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/top-and-bottom.png" alt="times series for the top and bottom halves of the frequency range" border="0" width="450" height="295" /></p>
<p>The two curves trace almost exactly the same time course. Or maybe that&#8217;s not so uninformative after all: It tells us that whatever phenomenon causes the slump, the effect is spread out over the entire vocabulary, not just words in a certain frequency range.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another just-so story I&#8217;ve been telling myself in an attempt to understand the Nixonian swoon. The 1960s is when phototypesetting began to displace the older technology of metal type. Suppose that some characteristic of early phototypeset books causes trouble for optical character recognition (OCR) systems. On reading such a book, the OCR program would report an exaggerated number of unique words (since instances of a given word could be read in various different erroneous ways) but the total number of word occurrences would remain constant (since every word is still recognized as <em>some</em> word). This isn&#8217;t exactly the pattern we&#8217;re seeing, but there&#8217;s one more factor to take into account. In the Harvard-Google data set, no word is included unless it appears at least 40 times. If the phototypeset text caused the OCR system to misread the same word in many different ways, some of those errors would fail to reach the 40-occurrence threshold and would just disappear. Thus the total occurrence count could decline even as the number of distinct words increased.</p>
<p>Lying awake in the middle of the night, I thought this story sounded really good. When I got up in the morning, I ran a test. If an unusual number of words are falling off the bottom of the distribution during the Nixon years, then we should also see a bulge just above the bottom, consisting of those words that just barely reached the threshold. But here&#8217;s the time series for the 15,518 words with exactly 40 occurrences:</p>
<p><img class="centered" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/rarest-by-date-2.png" alt="time series for words with exactly 40 occurrences" border="0" width="450" height="288" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no hump in the late 60s. On the contrary, the curve looks much like all the rest, with the same sorry sag. Isn&#8217;t it annoying when mere fact overturns a perfectly lovely theory?</p>
<p>But enough of the Watergate era. I have a few more loose ends to tie up.</p>
<p>A graph in the magazine illustrates our collective fondness for round numbers&#8212;those divisible by 5 or 10. I remark in the text: &#8220;Dollar amounts are even more dramatically biased in favor of well-rounded numbers.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the evidence:</p>
<p><img class="centered" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dollars-0-100a.png" alt="frequency of dollar amounts for numbers from $1 to $100" border="0" width="450" height="306" /></p>
<p>Dollar amounts mod $1 tell the same story:</p>
<p><img class="centered" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/cents-1-99.png" alt="prevalence of cents values between 1 and 99" border="0" width="450" height="277" /></p>
<p>I was not surprised at the prominence of $X.25, $X.50 and $X.75, but in this graph I had expected also to see a strong signal from prices a penny less than a dollar. That signal is detectable but not conspicuous. Apparently, items mentioned in books&#8212;perhaps the books themselves&#8212;are more commonly priced at $X.95.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to mention two small but troublesome anomalies in the downloadable 1-gram files. The Google OCR algorithms treat most marks of punctuation as separate 1-grams. Thus we can count how many periods, colons and question marks appeared in printed books over the years. But the encoding of two of these symbols was garbled somewhere along the way. The most abundant 1-gram in the entire data set&#8212;with 21,396,850,115 occurrences, or about 6 percent of the total&#8212;is listed in the files as the double quotation mark. In fact it should be identified as the comma. (In the web interface to the online Ngram Viewer, the comma is a separator, which may have something to do with the confusion in the downloadable files. The character is correctly given as a comma in the private files of Aiden and Michel.)</p>
<p>The second problem entry is even weirder. Loaded into a text editor, it looks like this:</p>
<p>
<pre>                          """ "</pre>
</p>
<p>Closer examination with a binary editor shows that the space between the third and fourth quote marks consists of two control characters, with hexadecimal values 0&#215;15 (NAK) and 0&#215;12 (DC2). I make no sense of this, and Aiden and Michel have not yet been able to help. All the same, I think I know how to fix it. If the entry for the double quotation mark is actually a comma, then something else has to be the double quote. This bizarre character string looks like a good candidate.</p>

The second graph shows the year-over-year (YoY) change in reported existing home inventory and months-of-supply. Inventory is not seasonally adjusted, so it really helps to look at the YoY change. <br />

This is the second consecutive month with a small YoY decrease in inventory.<br />
<br />
Inventory should increase over the next few months (the normal seasonal pattern), and the YoY change is something to watch closely this year. Inventory is already very high, and any YoY increase in inventory would put more downward pressure on house prices.<br />

<br />
The red columns in January, February and March are for 2011. <br />
<br />

• <strong>Housing Starts increased in March</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
Single-family starts increased 7.7% to 422 thousand in March (February was revised up to 392 thousand from 375 thousand). <br />
<br />
The graph shows total and single unit starts since 1968. This shows the huge collapse following the housing bubble, and that housing starts have mostly been moving sideways for over two years - with slight ups and downs due to the home buyer tax credit.<br />
<br />
• <strong>AIA: Architecture Billings Index little changed in March</strong><br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?CRE#category=CRE&chart=ABIMar2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1070,height=755,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="AIA Architecture Billing Index" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1WYh6AImOew/Ta5TYKPBu5I/AAAAAAAAKKY/qrWYYU-BlWM/s320/ABIMar2011.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> This graph shows the Architecture Billings Index since 1996. The index showed billings increased slightly in March (index at 50.5, anything above indicates an increase in billings).<br />
<br />
Note: Nonresidential construction includes commercial and industrial facilities like hotels and office buildings, as well as schools, hospitals and other institutions.<br />
<br />
According to the AIA, there is an "approximate nine to twelve month lag time between architecture billings and construction spending" on non-residential construction. So this indicator suggests the drag from CRE investment will end mid-year 2011 or so - but there won't be a strong increase in investment.<br />
<br />
• <strong>Moody's: Commercial Real Estate Prices declined 3.3% in February</strong><br />
<br />
Moody's <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-22/u-s-commercial-property-prices-fell-for-second-straight-month-in-january.html">reported</a> that the Moody’s/REAL All Property Type Aggregate Index declined 3.3% in February. Note: Moody's CRE price index is a repeat sales index like Case-Shiller - but there are far fewer commercial sales and there are a large percentage of distressed sales - and that can impact prices and make the index very volatile.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?CRE#category=CRE&amp;chart=MoodysCPPIFeb2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1210,height=750,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="CRE and Residential Price indexes" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kbIHGWj1AJU/Ta8hawNqslI/AAAAAAAAKK0/dpMb3_gSAe4/s320/MoodysCPPIFeb2011.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> Here is a comparison of the Moodys/REAL Commercial Property Price Index (CPPI) and the Case-Shiller composite 20 index.  The Case-Shiller Composite 20 residential index is in blue (with Dec 2000 set to 1.0 to line up the indexes). <br />
<br />
According to Moody's, CRE prices are down 4.9% from a year ago and down about 44.7% from the peak in 2007.  Prices are just above the post-bubble low last August - and about at the levels of 2002.<br />

<div>Description: </div>
<div>Content:
From David Streitfeld at the NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/business/economy/23housing.html">Builders of New Homes Seeing No Sign of Recovery</a><br />
<blockquote>Builders and analysts say a long-term shift in behavior seems to be under way. Instead of wanting the biggest and the newest, even if it requires a long commute, buyers now demand something smaller, cheaper and, thanks to $4-a-gallon gas, as close to their jobs as possible. That often means buying a home out of foreclosure from a bank. <br />
<br />
Four out of 10 sales of existing homes are foreclosures or otherwise distressed properties. Builders ... cannot compete despite chopping prices. </blockquote>This has led to the "distressing gap" between new and existing home sales! Here is a repeat of the graph showing existing home sales (left axis) and new home sales (right axis). This graph starts in 1994, but the relationship has been fairly steady back to the '60s. Then along came the housing bubble and bust, and the "distressing gap" appeared (due mostly to distressed sales).<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?New-Home#category=New-Home&amp;chart=DistressingGapFeb2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1130,height=770,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Distressing Gap" border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tuuWNz8JlJg/TYoicF15MOI/AAAAAAAAKDs/uWBx8D3w-LM/s320/DistressingGapFeb2011.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> <i><b><span style="font-size: 85%;">Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.</span></b></i><br />
<br />
The gap is due mostly to the flood of distressed sales. This has kept existing home sales elevated, and depressed new home sales since builders can't compete with the low prices of all the foreclosed properties. <br />
<br />
In a few years - when the excess housing inventory is absorbed and the number of distressed sales has declined significantly - I expect existing home-to-new home sales to return to something close to this historical relationship.<br />
<br />
Also - earlier this week I mentioned a possible change in sentiment toward homeownership - Streitfeld picked this up and I appreciate the mention!<div class="blogger-post-footer">Link to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculatedriskblog</a>!<img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10004977-3582039213175897135?l=www.calculatedriskblog.com' alt='' /></div></div>

To see why you should vote in favour of the move to Alternative Voting on the 5th of May, look no further than the <a href="http://www.no2av.org/why-vote-no/current-system/">contorted arguments</a> of its opponents. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2011/apr/18/politics-live-blog">Here</a> is David Cameron on the topic:<blockquote>Too often debates about AV are less like political arguments, and more like scientific discussions, where people get lost in a language of proportionality and preferences, probabilities and possibilities.<br /><br />Of course, some of these things are important. But for me, politics shouldn't be some mind-bending exercise. It's about what you feel in your gut – about the values you hold dear and the beliefs you instinctively have. And I just feel it, in my gut, that AV is wrong.</blockquote><br />To think that we (the academic community) once had him eating out of our hands, studying for a degree on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy,_Politics_and_Economics">Philosophy, Politics and Economics</a>.

<br />
Changes and comments from surferdude808: <br />
<blockquote>Given the flurry of closings last week and the Easter weekend, it is probably safe to assume the FDIC will be on the sidelines this Friday. During the week, however, there were four removals and two additions, which leave the Unofficial Problem Bank List standing at 976 institutions with assets of $422.2 billion. <br />
<br />
The FDIC terminated its action against CIT Bank, Salt Lake City, UT ($7.1 billion). The other removals were further intercompany consolidations by the multi-bank holding company Metropolitan Bank Group, Inc., first mentioned last week. This week Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, IL ($307 million); Chicago Community Bank, Chicago, IL ($276 million); and Community Bank of DuPage, Downers Grove, IL ($63 million) merged into the affiliated Metro Bank (f/k/a Citizens Community Bank Of Illinois), Berwyn, IL, which is also on the Unofficial Problem Bank List.<br />
<br />
The new addition are Hopkins Federal Savings Bank, Baltimore, MD ($355 million) and TransPecos Banks, Pecos, TX ($157 million). Look for more activity next week as the FDIC should release its enforcement actions through March 2011 on April 29th.</blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer">Link to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculatedriskblog</a>!<img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10004977-7418351567543373232?l=www.calculatedriskblog.com' alt='' /></div></div>

<p>A friend IMed me the other day, asking, &#8220;You know how to make people click on things.  I&#8217;m submitting something to Reddit &mdash; can you help me title the post?&#8221; A stark description of my skills, certainly, but it made me laugh and inspired me to write an article about the art of click hacking.</p>

<h3>What is click hacking?</h3>
<p>
Aside from being a term I just made up, <strong>click hacking</strong> is a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)">social engineering</a> where the goal is to get someone to click a hyperlink.
</p>

<p>
The link could be the title of a Reddit post, a button on a landing page form that&#8217;s trying to capture your email, or an image in a Facebook ad.  Deception can be, but is not necessarily involved.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m going to use Facebook, Hacker News, and Reddit as the primary examples throughout this article because I know them best.  If you have other examples please leave a comment!
</p>

<h3>For Good or Evil</h3>
<p>
All the tactics I&#8217;m about to describe can be used for good or evil, and I&#8217;ve seen each used for both.  Don&#8217;t take this article as an endorsement for spamming, scamming, or other internet trickery.
</p>

<p>
There&#8217;s plenty of grey area, too.  At its start Reddit faked on-site activity to avoid looking like a ghost town.  Was that unethical?  A mistake?
</p>

<p>
None of these tactics are a substitute for generating real value for your customer, though they will help you understand how your customers react to what you present them (and how to incentivize them to react the way you want).  The hard (and most important) parts are still up to you.
</p>

<p>With that disclaimer aside, let&#8217;s dive into specifics.</p>

<h3>Understand Your Audience</h3>
<p>
Above all else, I take the time to understand my audience.  Each online community has its own customs, norms, and standards of behavior.  You have to understand them before you can blend in or stand out as necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljyor743nc1qzrifqo1_500.png"><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljyor743nc1qzrifqo1_500.png" width="200" align="right" /></a>

For example, Hacker News values civility<sup><a href="http://20bits.com/articles/click-hacking-for-fun-and-profit/#footnote_0_758" id="identifier_0_758" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See, e.g., Some Tips to Improve the Civility on Hacker News.">1</a></sup>, straight-dealing, and intellectual honesty, but can be a little short-sighted and dour.  Reddit values wit (especially puns and in-jokes/memes) and has a strong sense of community justice.  It can also be completely juvenile. 
</p>


<p>
From the click hacker&#8217;s perspective, a pun-filled title could do well on Reddit, but would never see the light of day on Hacker News.
</p>

<h3>Ask for Help or Feedback</h3>
<p>
One way to get people to pay attention is to ask for help.  Hacker News has a &#8220;<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/ask">Ask HN</a>&#8221; feature which evolved purely from community behavior.  There are similar &#8220;Tell HN&#8221; and &#8220;Review my Startup&#8221; features.
</p>

<p>
For example, here is <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863">Drew Houston&#8217;s original Hacker News post</a> asking for reviews of Dropbox.  Every startup I know wants to publish a &#8220;showoff&#8221; entry on Hacker News and have it get to the front page, and their motives range from honest (they really want feedback) to self-serving (they just want the attention).
</p>

<h3>Give a Gift</h3>
<p>
Everyone loves gifts, but when we receive them we also feel pressure to reciprocate.  The click hacker can use that pressure to get people to do what they want.
</p>

<p>
This tactic is the difference between &#8220;I baked a cake&#8221; and &#8220;I baked a cake <em>for you</em>.&#8221;  A normal person is obliged to accept and even reciprocate.
</p>

<p>
For example, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/e45ch/">this Reddit user</a> wrote a CSS hack to change the appearance of the site &mdash; a little present for anyone using Reddit.  The Reddit community reciprocated by giving him upvotes.
</p>

<p>
Notice how he says he made it &#8220;for Reddit.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9h520/my_wife_made_me_a_reddit_alien_birthday_cake_it/c0cracz">cake example</a> works, too, though. :)
</p>

<h3>Bribery</h3>
<p>
Bribery is the opposite of gift-giving.  In this situation the click hacker says, &#8220;Do this for me and I&#8217;ll give you something.&#8221;  If that something is really awesome people will do almost anything.
</p>

<p>
The stereotypical example here are those scammy ads for free iPods and the like.  All you have to do is fill out this form and click this link and you&#8217;ll be entered to win.  Or, hey, instead maybe you can forward this offer to three of your friends, and if one of them wins, you win, too!
</p>

<p>
This can be done well in certain contexts.  For example, Facebook game developers often trade installs by paying players virtual currency, e.g., &#8220;Install this game to earn ten farm dollars.&#8221;  Or a game developer might have a special landing page offering players virtual currency as a way to encourage the player to click the install button. 
</p>

<p>
The player gets what they want (virtual currency) and the game developer acquired a customer for free.
</p>

<p>
Assuming the terms are clearly outlined there&#8217;s nothing wrong with this.  Of course, there&#8217;s plenty of room for outright dishonesty by promising goods that never arrive.  Don&#8217;t be that guy.
</p>

<h3>Scarcity</h3>
<p>
People want what they can&#8217;t have.  Or, more accurately, people want what they think they can&#8217;t have.
</p>

<p>
Gilt, for example, relies heavily on this tactic to drive sales.  Better click that buy button now, because we&#8217;re running out!
</p>

<p>
In Gilt&#8217;s case the scarcity is legitimate, but it can be artificial, too.  A game developer might make an in-game object ultra-rare in order to drive specific behavior.  Limited beta invites are a tried-and-true method of generating traffic and interest; give out 20 invites to an audience of 20,000 and collect follow-up information for the people who don&#8217;t get there in time.
</p>

<p>
Scarcity also works with time, e.g., &#8220;If you install this game within the next thirty seconds, you&#8217;ll get a ten credit bonus.&#8221;  Tick, tick, tick, tock.
</p>

<h3>Social Proof</h3>
<p>
Similar to scarcity, people don&#8217;t want to feel like they&#8217;re missing out.  If they see other people doing something, especially people they know or respect, they&#8217;ll be more likely to do it.
</p>

<p>
This is the <em>raison d&#8217;être</em> for Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/facepile/">Facepile</a> widget.  Click that Like button.  You know you want to.  Come on, all your friends are doing it.
</p>

<p>
Even adding faces of random but friendly-looking people can be effective in getting people to click through.  Here&#8217;s a screenshot of Match.com&#8217;s homepage.
</p>

<a href="http://20bits.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/match-com.jpg"><img src="http://20bits.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/match-com.jpg" alt="Match.com homepage" title="Match.com homepage" width="500" class="aligncenter math size-medium wp-image-811" /></a>

<p>Look at all those happy people.  Don&#8217;t you want to be happy, too?</p>

<h3>Pick a Fight</h3>
<p>
Rather than trying to blend in with a community, some times it helps to generate controversy.  This can either be you vs. the community, or setting two factions within a community against each other.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;ll share a story myself.  Back in 2009 I was working on a polling application for Facebook.  People would vote in polls and their vote would appear in their newsfeed.
</p>

<p>
The most controversial topics were the most successful, so to get things started I created a poll: &#8220;Do you support same-sex marriage?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
This was just after the Proposition 8 fight, so I decided to run two sets of ads on Facebook: one targeting 50 miles around San Francisco and another targeting 50 miles around Salt Lake City.
</p>

<p>
I can&#8217;t say it was a win for civil political discourse, but it generated enough controversy to make that poll viral and in turn make the entire application viral.<sup><a href="http://20bits.com/articles/click-hacking-for-fun-and-profit/#footnote_1_758" id="identifier_1_758" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The way that application died makes a good story, too.">2</a></sup>
</p>

<h3>Environmental Flaws</h3>
<p>
Sometimes the environment has flaws which allow the click hacker to do some interesting things.
</p>

<p>
When Facebook first launched their user-generated polling product, I remember seeing several polls asking questions like, &#8220;Which model is hotter?&#8221;  The possible answers were URLs of images.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for the user, clicking on the text of the answer (the URL in this case) would register a vote and post that vote to your newsfeed.  Their friends, who of course also wanted to see pictures of hot models,  clicked the URLs, accidentally voted, and spread the poll to their friends.  Oops!
</p>

<p>
Click hackers were using this mis-feature deliberately to spread new polls across Facebook.<sup><a href="http://20bits.com/articles/click-hacking-for-fun-and-profit/#footnote_2_758" id="identifier_2_758" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There&amp;#8217;s a blog post describing data from this social hack &amp;mdash; if anyone has it please share it in the comments!">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
I don&#8217;t think many people will disagree when I say that most of the growth on the Facebook Platform from 2007-2009 was built on similar environmental flaws.  Here&#8217;s a two-year old example from Slide&#8217;s Super Pocus:
</p>

<img src="http://20bits.com/downloads/super-pocus.png" alt="" title="Super Pocus click hacking" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-378 math">

<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>What else am I missing?  Post examples in the comments.</p>

<p>Have you ever been &#8220;tricked&#8221; into clicking something?  (I know I have.) Have a funny story?  Have experience optimizing landing pages, etc. and think about this all the time anyway?  Leave a comment and share!</p>

While it is an impressive book, by its description of domestic violence and of its impact on the children and grand-children of abusive fathers, it is not exactly a detective story because there is not much in terms of police work&#8230; The book is terrifying in the spiral of physical and psychological violence suffered by the family and it is no wonder the book got several awards (<em>Glass Key</em> award 2003, <em>CWA Gold Dagger</em> 2005, Grand Prix des lectrices de <em>Elle</em> 2007). However, having the two stories exposed in parallel, the one of the suffering family in the 1940&#8242;s and the uncovering of the grave in the early 2000&#8242;s, reduces the plot in the current era to a spectator&#8217;s game, the reader being aware of much more than the policemen conducting the inquiry, and suspecting in particular that the body slowly unearthed by the archaeologists can only be one of two members of this doomed family&#8230; I must say I preferred <a href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/vetrarborgin/">Arctic Chill</a>, especially because of the vision it gave of the contemporary Icelandic society, but this novel<strong><em> Graforþögn</em></strong> also contains insights about an older, more rural and just as cruel, Iceland that WWII was going to change so radically.</p>

From the LA Times: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gang-of-six-20110423,0,1503931.story">Gang of Six gives old-time politics a try</a><br />
<blockquote>The six senators — three Democrats, three Republicans — working behind closed doors to deal with the nation's debt crisis have put aside the hyper-partisanship of today's Washington and are engaging in the give-and-take necessary to craft an agreement.<br />
...<br />
For now, the group's deliberations are largely secret. But its proposals are expected to include changes in the government's most costly programs — defense, the healthcare safety net and Social Security — as well as the closure of tax loopholes.</blockquote>I do not want to prejudge the result of these meetings, however I've outlined my <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/comment-on-deficit.html">suggestions</a> on how to approach the deficit issue. <br />
<br />
I'd be happy if the "Gang of Six" just offered a proposal on how to close the structural general fund deficit ex-healthcare. That would be an important first step ... and I think should be THE first step.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Link to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculatedriskblog</a>!<img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10004977-2043629625936298108?l=www.calculatedriskblog.com' alt='' /></div></div>

Right then, with a simple read your three month's time investment is gone to waste. It's too bad. So instead of having a bunch of CS papers to read over the week-end, here is an open ended problem with open ended questions:</div><br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">This video shows <a href="http://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/71/11">Ed Boyden</a> explaining the technique currently investigated of the stimulation of brain cells through some sort of structured lighting. Here is the <a href="http://syntheticneurobiology.org/publications">publication page of his lab</a>. This is a fascinating subject at the cross road of technology, physics and biology together. The patient (right now they are at the animal trials) is injected with a biomarker that will produce some electric field when shone by light at some specified wavelength. However, since there are many places in the brain where one would want to have an (electrical) effect, a single fiber optic cannot really do the job.&nbsp;<a href="http://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/71/11">Ed&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;and his teams have devised a way for the delivery of multiple rays of light along the fiber[1].</div><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7qzAVKwZM6Y/TbGpfyZmNSI/AAAAAAAAEnk/i_-8dVuyDxE/s1600/multiplex.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7qzAVKwZM6Y/TbGpfyZmNSI/AAAAAAAAEnk/i_-8dVuyDxE/s320/multiplex.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">I wonder how fine tuned their light multiplexing system is ? So here is my first open ended question: how can you improve the technology to get more than one structured lighting in ? Right now the configuration does not seem to allow for modulation. Lines of thoughts might include <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2010/02/cs-blind-compressed-sensing-some-more.html">Opaque Lenses</a>.<br />
<br />
Once you have delivered all these lights beam throughout the brain, you also want to check the response of the brain.<a href="http://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/71/11"> Ed </a>and his team used fMRI to see how the cells eventually react in the brain.[2]<br />
<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y8An-eUWMg0/TbGplkruaZI/AAAAAAAAEns/OhfwScmvZYM/s1600/light-probe.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y8An-eUWMg0/TbGplkruaZI/AAAAAAAAEns/OhfwScmvZYM/s320/light-probe.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">Other open ended questions include:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>one structured lighting yields one response, if one allows for some light multiplexing, one could consider compressed sensing as a technique to be used but is the brain response linear ?</li>
<li>In the affirmative, are there good reasons to expect a sparse solution in this system of linear equations involving light inputs and MRI outputs ?</li>
<li>.....</li>
</ul><br />

That was also the highest percentage since the annual Business Climate survey began eight years ago<br />
...<br />
Fifty-five percent of the CEOs polled anticipate job growth in the region to be better in 2011. Only 5 percent expect it to be worse.</blockquote>That is good news.<br />

<p><font color="#808080">Got a question about <i>Mathematica</i>? The Wolfram Blog has answers! We&#8217;ll regularly answer selected questions from users around the web. You can <a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/ask-a-question/">submit your question directly to the Q&#038;A Team using this form</a>.</font></p>
<p>This week&#8217;s question comes from Brian, who is a part-time math teacher:</p>
<p><b><i>How do you plot trigonometric functions in degrees instead of radians?</i></b></p>
<p>Trigonometric functions in <i>Mathematica</i> such as <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Sin.html">Sin</a>[x]</tt> and <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Cos.html">Cos</a>[x]</tt> take <i>x</i> to be given in radians:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Trigonometric-functions.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Trigonometric functions" title="Trigonometric functions" width="276" height="23" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5407" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Plot-trigonometric-function.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Plot trigonometric function" title="Plot trigonometric function" width="414" height="233" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5408" /><br />
<span id="more-5406"></span></p>
<p>To convert from degrees to radians, multiply by &#960; &frasl; 180. This special constant is called <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Degree.html">Degree</tt></a> in <i>Mathematica</i>.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Cos-180-Degree.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Cos [180 Degree]" title="Cos [180 Degree]" width="149" height="24" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5409" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Cos-180-Degree-output.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Cos [180 Degree]" title="Cos [180 Degree]" width="65" height="23" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5410" /></p>
<p>The symbol &#176; is a handy shorthand for <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Degree.html">Degree</a></tt> and is entered as Esc-d-e-g-Esc. You can also find this symbol in the Basic Math Assistant palette in the Palettes menu of <i>Mathematica</i>.</p>
<p>Using either <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Degree.html">Degree</a></tt> or &#176;, you can plot trigonometric functions in degrees:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Plot-in-degrees.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Plot in degrees" title="Plot in degrees" width="299" height="24" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5411" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Plot-in-degrees-output.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Plot in degrees" title="Plot in degrees" width="408" height="234" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5412" /></p>
<p>That answers the main question, but here&#8217;s a related hint.</p>
<p>When plotting trigonometric functions in degrees, you might also want to manually specify exactly where <i>Mathematica</i> draws tick marks. You can do this using the <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Ticks.html">Ticks</a></tt> option:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Ticks-option.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Ticks option" title="Ticks option" width="316" height="38" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5413" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Ticks-option-output.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Ticks option" title="Ticks option" width="416" height="227" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5414" /></p>
<p>(Here, <tt>Range[0, 360, 45]</tt> specifies the tick marks on the <i>x</i> axis, and <tt>Automatic</tt> uses the default tick marks on the <i>y</i> axis.)</p>

<p>For our first post in this new series of <i>Mathematica</i> Q&#038;A articles, we&#8217;re going to address a very frequently asked question about plotting in <i>Mathematica</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>How can I control the appearance of discontinuities in a plot?</b></i></p>
<p>The short answer is, use the options <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Exclusions.html"><tt>Exclusions</tt></a> and <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/ExclusionsStyle.html"><tt>ExclusionsStyle</tt></a>! Let&#8217;s see how they work.</p>
<p>By default, <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Plot.html"><tt>Plot</tt></a> shows the function 1 &frasl; sin(<i>x</i>) with lines joining its discontinuities:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/1-sinx.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="1 / sin(x)" title="1 / sin(x)" width="206" height="44" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5126" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/1-sinx-plot.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="1 / sin(x) plot" title="1 / sin(x) plot" width="353" height="201" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5127" /><br />
<span id="more-5125"></span></p>
<p>You can use the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Exclusions.html"><tt>Exclusions</tt></a> option to exclude points from the plot:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Exclusions.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Exclusions" title="Exclusions" width="379" height="47" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5128" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Exclude-points-from-plot.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Exclude points from plot" title="Exclude points from plot" width="355" height="201" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5129" /></p>
<p>Instead of excluding the points, you can specify a <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Style.html">style</a> to apply to them:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Exclusion-style.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Exclusion style" title="Exclusion style" width="375" height="75" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5130" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Exclusion-style-plot.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Exclusion style plot" title="Exclusion style plot" width="347" height="194" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5131" /></p>
<p>For explicitly piecewise functions like <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Floor.html"><tt>Floor</tt></a>, points are excluded automatically:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Floor-function.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Floor function" title="Floor function" width="395" height="25" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5132" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Floor-function-plot.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Floor function plot" title="Floor function plot" width="357" height="212" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5133" /></p>
<p>(You can use <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Exclusions.html"><tt>Exclusions</tt></a> &rarr; <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/None.html"><tt>None</tt></a> to disable this.)</p>
<p>The exclusions options work with many other <i>Mathematica</i> functions, such as <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Plot3D.html"><tt>Plot3D</tt></a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Plot3D-function.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Plot 3D function" title="Plot 3D function" width="421" height="46" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5134" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Plot-3D.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Plot 3D" title="Plot 3D" width="352" height="272" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5265" /></p>
<p>We specified two styles using <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/ExclusionsStyle.html"><tt>ExclusionsStyle</tt></a>: the first style is applied to the excluded region, while the second style is applied to its boundary.</p>
<p>You can create some spectacular visualizations with these options. <a href='http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/MathematicaQAExcludingPointsFromPlots.cdf'>Download the Computable Document Format (CDF) file</a> for this post to see how to generate this one:</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Earlier this week, data scientists Pete Warden and Alasdair Allen <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/apple-location-tracking.html" target="_self">reported</a> that iPhones and cell-enabled iPads keep an internal log of the devices location, which is accessible from the backup that iTunes creates when you sync the device. Naturally, there&#39;s been some <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/your-iphone-is-tracking-you-so-what/?src=tptw" target="_self">controversy</a> over the privacy implications of the data keing kept, but from a data scientist&#39;s perspective this represents a rich and interesting data source for analysis. Personally, I&#39;m kind of interested to get access to where I&#39;ve been over the past year: wherever I go, my iPhone goes.</p>
<p>Pete Warden has provided a <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/your-iphone-is-tracking-you-so-what/?src=tptw" target="_self">tool</a> that lets you easily access and map the data. Here&#39;s why the data for my iPhone looks like when zoomed in on California:</p>
<p><a href="http://revolution-computing.typepad.com/.a/6a010534b1db25970b014e87ff6b03970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IPhoneMap" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010534b1db25970b014e87ff6b03970d image-full" src="http://revolution-computing.typepad.com/.a/6a010534b1db25970b014e87ff6b03970d-800wi" title="IPhoneMap" /></a> <br /> <br />If you have more than one iDevice the tool only shows the data from the one you most recently synced, and more importantly it doesn&#39;t (directly) give you access to the location data if you want to do more with it. Drew Conway comes to the rescue with an <a href="https://github.com/drewconway/stalkR#readme" target="_self">R package</a> (amusingly called stalkR) that lets you import the data from a named device into an R object for visualization or other analysis. You&#39;ll need to make sure the dependent R packages are installed, and download and install the stalkR_0.01.tar.gz file in your R working directory:</p>

<p>Last week, the world was shocked by the news of massive earthquakes and devastating tsunamis in Japan. The event is still unfolding and could become one of the most tragic natural disasters in recent history.</p>
<p>Scientific understanding and modeling of complicated physical phenomena and engineering based on such analysis is imperative to prevent unnecessary loss of life from natural disasters. In this post, we&#8217;ll explore the science behind earthquakes to better understand why they happen and how we prepare for them.</p>
<p>Note: The dynamic examples in this post were built using <em><a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a></em>. <a href='http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/BuiltToLastUnderstandingEarthquakeEngineering1.cdf'>Download the Computable Document Format (CDF) file</a> provided to interact with the simulations and further explore the topics.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s start with locations. The following visualization is created from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) database of earthquakes that occurred between 1973 and early 2011 whose magnitudes were over 5. As you can clearly see, the epicenters are concentrated in narrow areas, usually on the boundaries of tectonic plates. In particular, there are severe seismic activities around the Pacific, namely the &#8220;Ring of Fire&#8221;. Unfortunately, Japan is sitting right in the middle of this highly active area.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5335" src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Earthquake-map2.gif" alt="Earthquake map" width="500" height="303" /><br />
<span id="more-5268"></span></p>
<p>Earthquakes are oftentimes caused at the boundaries of tectonic plates, which form huge faults on the surface. When large enough forces are applied in two different directions, they overcome the friction between the boundary and cause a sudden movement. The phenomenon, also known as strike-slip, is one of many mechanisms that causes earthquakes. The following animation simulates the strike-slip at a fault and seismic waves caused by it.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="500" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KLCEtqANQew?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>
<p>The scale of an earthquake is measured by the amount of released energy during the seismic activity. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. The following chart shows the relation between the scale and the energy released by the event, with a few recent major earthquakes indicated.</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript">// 
$(document).ready(function() {$("#mainImage").hover(function () {$("#image01").toggle();$("#image02").toggle();},function () {$("#image02").toggle();$("#image01").toggle();});});

</span></span></p>
<p>PJ, or petajoule, may not be the most familiar measurement unit of energy for many people. We can use <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com">Wolfram|Alpha</a> to convert it to more popular measures, such as megatons of TNT explosive. The Sendai earthquake was measured at magnitude 9, and the energy released was approximately 2000 petajoules:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5284" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/2000-PJ-to-megatons.gif" alt="2000 PJ to megatons" width="222" height="60" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5285" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/478-megatons-of-TNT.gif" alt="478 megatons of TNT" width="184" height="49" /></p>
<p>To put it into some context, the largest nuclear explosive ever tested (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Tsar+Bomba">Tsar Bomba</a>) was roughly 58 megatons. We are talking about an order of magnitude more energy than that of the largest nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>The magnitude scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale. For instance, the difference in energy released between the current Sendai earthquake (magnitude 9) and the Haiti earthquake in 2010 (magnitude 7) is:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5286" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/energydifference1.gif" alt="Energy difference" width="345" height="40" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5287" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/energydifference2.gif" alt="Energy difference" width="198" height="26" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5288" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/differencebetweentwoearthquakes.gif" alt="Energy difference" width="74" height="24" /></p>
<p>Thus, the energy released during the Sendai earthquake is 1000 times more than that of the Haiti.</p>
<p>So, how is all the energy from earthquakes transferred? Most of the energy is converted into heat generated by friction, but some of it is transformed and radiated as seismic waves. There are two types of seismic waves: body waves and surface waves.</p>
<p>Body waves travel through the earth and can be differentiated by the direction of oscillation during propagation. In P-waves, the particles vibrate in the same direction as wave propagation, similar to sound waves. On the contrary, particles move perpendicular to the direction of the propagation in S-waves.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="500" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2rYjlVPU9U4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="500" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/en4HptC0mQ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>
<p>Surface waves travel only through the crust or the surface of the Earth. However, they are responsible for much destruction due to their properties. Again, the surface waves can be divided into two: <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=A.E.H.+Love">Love</a> and <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=John+William+Strutt">Rayleigh</a> waves.</p>
<p>Love waves create motions similar to S-waves, but horizontally. This horizontal movement is particularly damaging to the foundations of buildings.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="500" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/t7wJu0Kts7w?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>
<p>Rayleigh waves traverse the way that waves roll across lakes or oceans. During propagation, particles move in elliptical paths. Sometimes called ground rolls, Rayleigh waves are low frequency (less than 20 Hz) and oftentimes are detected by animals, but not humans.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="500" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6cuEqyYIr24?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>
<p>Understanding seismic waves is essential for minimizing or preventing structural damages to buildings during earthquakes. So the question is, what you can do?</p>
<p>If external forces are applied, buildings will <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhJzdtzl6KY" target="_blank">sway</a>. The structural dynamics are quite complex and depend on a lot of parameters. But as an example, I used a simple damped harmonic oscillator equation to simulate the sway of a building in the following animation (the gray cylinders represent the foundations of the building):</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="500" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ijPncJPmQ-k?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>
<p>The sway helps to dissipate energy from the seismic waves. Through structural design, material selection, and construction techniques, engineers have tried to reduce the effect of earthquakes on buildings. One such example is a tuned mass damper, a device installed in buildings to reduce harmonic resonance.</p>

Photo courtesy of Armand du Plessis.</p></div>
<p>Another option that is widely considered today is a technique called base isolation, or seismic isolation. In nutshell, you put some devices, such as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_engineering#Lead_rubber_bearing" target="_blank">lead rubber bearing</a>, at the base of a building to isolate the building structure from the vibration from earthquakes.</p>

<p>This technique can help reduce structural stress significantly. It is also considered to be a good option for short buildings with high stiffness, or for retrofitting existing structures. In fact, many historical monuments in the U.S. have already been retrofitted with base isolation systems to reduce the damage from earthquakes.</p>

<div>Content:

        <p>I received the following email from someone who'd like to remain anonymous:</p>

<blockquote>Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.

<p>The articles were published in the <a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.25.1.209">Journal of Economic Perspectives</a> and <a href="http://rss.sagepub.com/content/23/1/35.full.pdf+html">Rationality & Society</a>.  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/11/4862.abstract?sid=1caf3e43-caa2-4bd3-aa51-1cc65d81a1e9">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America</a>.</p>

<p>To say it in Sopranos like style - with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:</p>

<p>1) When building a track record and scientific reputation, it's publish or perish. What about young scholars that may have interesting stuff to say, but get rejected for (sometimes) obscure reasons, especially if you have innovative ideas that run against the mainstream. Meanwhile acceptance is granted to papers with identical messages in three journals that causes both congestion in the review procedures in biases acceptance, assuming that for two of three articles that are not entirely unique two other manuscripts will be rejected from an editorial  point of view to preserve exclusivity by sticking to low or constant acceptance rates. Do you see this as a problem? Or is the main point against this argument that if the other papers would have the quality they would be published.</p>

<p>2) As an author one usually gets the question on "are the results published in another journal" (and therefore not original) or "is this paper under review in an another journal". In their case the answer should be no for both answers as they report different results and use different methods in every paper. But if you check the descriptive statistics in the papers, they are awkwardly similar. At what point do these questions and the content overlap that it really causes problems for authors? Have you ever heard about any stories about double publications that were not authorized reprints or translations in other languages (which usually should not be problematic, as shown by the way in Frey publication list) and had to be withdrawn? Barely happens I guess.</p>

<p>Best regards and thank you for providing an open forum to discuss stuff like that.</blockquote></p>

<p>I followed the links and read the abstracts.  The three papers do indeed seem to describe similar work.  But the abstracts are in remarkably different styles.  The Rationality and Society abstract is short and doesn't say much.  The Journal of Economic Perspectives abstract is long with lots of detail but, oddly, no conclusions!  This abstract has the form of a movie trailer:  lots of explosions, lots of drama, but no revealing of the plot.  Finally, here's the PNAS abstract, which tells us what they found:</p>

<blockquote>To understand human behavior, it is important to know under what conditions people deviate from selfish rationality. This study explores the interaction of natural survival instincts and internalized social norms using data on the sinking of the Titanic and the Lusitania. We show that time pressure appears to be crucial when explaining behavior under extreme conditions of life and death. Even though the two vessels and the composition of their passengers were quite similar, the behavior of the individuals on board was dramatically different. On the Lusitania, selfish behavior dominated (which corresponds to the classical homo economicus); on the Titanic, social norms and social status (class) dominated, which contradicts standard economics. This difference could be attributed to the fact that the Lusitania sank in 18 min, creating a situation in which the short-run flight impulse dominated behavior. On the slowly sinking Titanic (2 h, 40 min), there was time for socially determined behavioral patterns to reemerge. Maritime disasters are traditionally not analyzed in a comparative manner with advanced statistical (econometric) techniques using individual data of the passengers and crew. Knowing human behavior under extreme conditions provides insight into how widely human behavior can vary, depending on differing external conditions. </blockquote>

<p>Interesting.  My only quibble here is with the phrase "selfish rationality," which comes up in the very first sentence.  As Aaron Edlin, Noah Kaplan, and I have stressed, rationality doesn't have to imply selfishness, and selfishness doesn't have to imply rationality.  One can achieve unselfish goals rationally.  For example, if I decide not to go on a lifeboat, I can still work to keep the peace and to efficiently pack people onto existing lifeboat slots.  I don't think this comment of mine affects the substance of the Frey et al. papers; it's just a slight change of emphasis.</p>

<p>Regarding the other question, of how could the same paper be published three times, my guess is that a paper on the Titanic can partly get published for its novelty value:  even serious journals like to sometimes run articles on offbeat topics.  I wouldn't be surprised if the editors of each journal thought:  Hey, this is fun.  We don't usually publish this sort of thing, but, hey, why not?  And then it appeared, three times.</p>

<p>How did this happen?  <strong>Arrow's theorem</strong>.  Let me explain.</p>
        <p>One day in graduate school, my friend Tex asked me if I knew what Arrow's Theorem was.  I said, yeah, it's something about the impossibility of a voting rule---No, he interrupted.  Not that one.  I'm talking about the other Arrow's Theorem.</p>

<p>The other Arrow's Theorem?  What's that, I asked.  Tex replied:  the theorem is that any result can only be published at most five times.</p>

<p>Hmm.  I thought about this one for a bit, and then Tex interrupted me again, saying:  That's the weak form of Arrow's Theorem.</p>

<p>I took the bait and asked, What's the strong form?</p>

<p>Tex replied;  <strong>The weak form of Arrow's Theorem is that any result can be published no more than five times.  The strong form is that every result <em>will</em> be published five times.</strong></p>

<p>Fast forward a few years.</p>

<p>It's 1995, and I'm wandering the fourth floor of Evans Hall in a daze, stunned that my colleagues have just voted by a 2-1 margin to kick me out of the statistics department.  Various conversations from the previous few years came to mind:  I gave one of my (non-Bayesian) colleagues a prepublication manuscript of Bayesian Data Analysis, and a couple days later he responded in a note that hierarchical models weren't new, he'd used them back in the late 1940s when he did applied statistics . . . another colleague who, after I'd given an entertaining pre-election talk to the department in late October, 1992 (this being Berkeley and Bill Clinton being way ahead in the polls, it was a festive occasion), had cornered me and said that before seeing my talk he'd never realized how little there was to this political science stuff . . . and after that same talk one of my more applied (!) colleagues asking me why, since votes are discrete, I wasn't using a discrete-data model such as a Poisson (and, no, he wasn't persuaded by my argument that if you have 100,000 votes in a congressional district, it's ok to model it as continuous) . . . and--and here's the point of this particular digression--one of my more genial colleagues, who'd asked me about my work on monitoring convergence of iterative simulations.  I assured him that the work was influential as well as innovative, to which he replied:  But if it's a good idea, why do you have only one paper on the topic?  A good research project will have several papers . . . </p>

<p>Arrow's theorem.</p>

<p>I'm very happy in New York and wouldn't trade my current life for anything, so Arrow's theorem did me a favor.  But still . . .</p>

<p>What's happened since then?  I never <em>intend</em> to publish the same thing over and over, but sometimes people ask me to write something for a journal, and I need to come with <em>something</em> . . .  And sometimes you really do want to reach different audiences.  I blog in 4 different places (here and the three "sister blogs" you see on the top of the blogroll here).  I certainly don't mind publishing blog entries in journals.  Or, to take a more fully academic example, Jennifer, Masanao, and I are publishing our paper on multiple comparisons in the Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness:  despite the obscure-seeming title, Jennifer assures me this is an influential venue.  We're also working on a related discussion paper for a statistics journal.  Different audiences.  For yet another example, I'm not the only researcher to get funding from multiple sources to do similar work.  And I think this is ok (as long as I do the work!).</p>

<p>And consider George Orwell.  He wrote the same thing over and over, hammering out his ideas in different low-circulation magazines.  To write is to think.</p>

<p>To return to the articles by Frey et al. discussed at the beginning:  Remember the strong form of Arrow's theorem.  Two more publications will come of this, for sure.</p>

<p>P.S.  Just to clarify:  No, I don't think Bruno Frey did anything wrong.</p>

<div>Description: There is an old word game where you try to get from one word to another through connections with other words. For example, you might get from &#8220;cold&#8221; to &#8220;stationary&#8221; via the word &#8220;frozen&#8221;, since &#8220;cold&#8221; and &#8220;frozen&#8221; are synonyms and &#8220;frozen&#8221; and &#8220;stationary&#8221; are synonyms, albeit for different meanings of the word &#8220;frozen&#8221;.

<div>Content:
<p>There is an old word game where you try to get from one word to another through connections with other words. For example, you might get from &ldquo;cold&rdquo; to &ldquo;stationary&rdquo; via the word &ldquo;frozen&rdquo;, since &ldquo;cold&rdquo; and &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; are synonyms and &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; and &ldquo;stationary&rdquo; are synonyms, albeit for different meanings of the word &ldquo;frozen&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I thought of this game when I started to learn the <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-8/graph-and-network-modeling/">new graph theory</a> functions in <a href="http://wolfram.com/mathematica"><i>Mathematica</i></a> 8. We can think of the words in the English language as the vertices of one large graph and the synonym connections between them as the graph edges. If you do that, it looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Synonym-connections-as-graph-edges.gif"><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Synonym-connections-as-graph-edges.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Synonym connections as graph edges" title="Synonym connections as graph edges" width="450" height="455" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5261" /></a></p>
<p>So let&#8217;s see if we can generally solve this synonym chain problem.<br />
<span id="more-5113"></span></p>
<p>First we need to create this graph representation of English and its synonym connectivity. I can get the raw data from the built-in <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/WordData.html">WordData</a></tt> function that accesses <a href="http://wolframalpha.com">Wolfram|Alpha</a>&#8217;s dictionary capabilities. The first problem is that the synonyms provided include idioms and phrases. While it might be useful to know that &#8220;zombie&#8221;  means the same thing as &#8220;living dead&#8221;, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s in the spirit of the game to use phrases. So first I will create a function to eliminate these, so that we are left with only single words.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Delete-phrases.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Delete phrases" title="Delete phrases" width="428" height="41" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5206" /></p>
<p>Next we need a function to pull together all the synonyms for all the alternative meanings of a word.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Get-synonyms.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Get synonyms" title="Get synonyms" width="401" height="56" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5207" /></p>
<p>Now we just apply that function to every single word in the <tt>WordData</tt> source and de-duplicate the results. The <sub><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Undirected-edge.gif" style="border: 0pt none" alt="Undirected edge" title="Undirected edge" width="26" height="13" /></sub> character indicates an undirected graph edge.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Deduplicate-results.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="De-duplicate results" title="De-duplicate results" width="432" height="68" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5208" /></p>
<p>Now that we have a graph representation of the synonyms, we can use the efficient <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/FindShortestPath.html"><tt>FindShortestPath</tt></a> function to get between any two connected words in the fewest number of hops. The rest of this function is just presentation.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/FindShortestPath.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="FindShortestPath" title="FindShortestPath" width="428" height="97" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5214" /></p>
<p>There is a lot of fun to be had out of this function, though sometimes the jumps that it makes can be hard to understand until you look up the more obscure meanings of some words in the dictionary. For me, the most fun is trying to connect seemingly opposite words. Some chains are very short, others quite long. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Connect-words.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Connect words" title="Connect words" width="500" height="647" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5215" /></p>
<p>Once you get bored of this game, the obvious question becomes, &ldquo;What is the longest such shortest chain?&rdquo; Or to put it another way, &ldquo;Which two words are furthest apart?&rdquo; If you click the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/GraphPlot.html"><tt>GraphPlot</tt></a> visualization of the data at the top of the post to see the large version, you will see that most of the words are in small clusters, many of only two or three words, but there is one large, highly interconnected group of words. It seems quite likely that that is the place to start looking. So I&#8217;ll start by getting the subgraph represented by the largest group of connected components.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Subgraph.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Subgraph" title="Subgraph" width="386" height="34" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5218" /></p>
<p>This subgraph has just under 20,000 vertices.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/VertexCount.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="VertexCount" title="VertexCount" width="266" height="20" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5219" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/VertexCount-output.gif" alt="VertexCount output" title="VertexCount output" width="94" height="20" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5220" /></p>
<p>The next largest group contains only 37 vertices, so we can probably just look at this cluster.</p>
<p>Now, the brute-force method would be to call <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/GraphDistanceMatrix.html"><tt>GraphDistanceMatrix</tt></a> on this and find all the shortest distances. If I were on a 64-bit platform, I might give that a go, but I would hit the memory ceiling on my 32-bit laptop, so I will have to use a more directed attack.</p>
<p>First, I will find some candidate words by measuring the eccentricity of each word. Eccentricity is the longest shortest distance between a vertex and all other vertices. It doesn&#8217;t return which partner vertex is that distance, but this way I don&#8217;t have to store all that data for the 20,000 words that are not candidates, or for all the words that are closer than the maximum. (Unfortunately, due to a bug in the initial release, you will need <i>Mathematica</i> 8.0.1 or higher to run this next line.) </p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Eccentricity-data.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Eccentricity data" title="Eccentricity data" width="414" height="52" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5221" /></p>
<p>By sorting the results, we can see here the 50 most eccentric words.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Sort-eccentricity-data.gif" style="border: 0pt none;"alt="Sort eccentricity data" title="Sort eccentricity data" width="283" height="21" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5222" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Sorted-words.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Sorted words" title="Sorted words" width="500" height="232" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5223" /></p>
<p>So now we can see that the longest shortest paths are 24 steps long. Here are the candidate words from this subgraph:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Eccentric-words.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Eccentric words" title="Eccentric words" width="466" height="22" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5224" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Candidate-words.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Candidate words" title="Candidate words" width="426" height="55" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5225" /></p>
<p>Now since this is an undirected graph, the word that partners with each of these words for the longest shortest path must also be from this set. So we just have to check the  <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/GraphDistance.html"><tt>GraphDistance</tt></a> for each combination to find which word it pairs up with. </p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/GraphDistance.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="GraphDistance" title="GraphDistance" width="435" height="142" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5226" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Table-form.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Table form" title="Table form" width="493" height="323" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5227" /></p>
<p>What we see is that each has multiple words that are the same 24 steps apart. But very quickly we see that they form groups: &ldquo;dejectedness&rdquo;, &ldquo;dispiritedness&rdquo;, &ldquo;downheartedness&rdquo;, and &ldquo;low-spiritedness&rdquo; are all synonyms of &ldquo;lowness&rdquo;, and &ldquo;aby&rdquo;, &ldquo;abye&rdquo;, and &ldquo;expiate&rdquo; are all synonyms of &ldquo;atone&rdquo;. So once we have seen one example, the other 11 possible ways to join the two groups are uninteresting. Here is one of them:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Connect-dejectedness-and-expiate.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Connect dejectedness and expiate" title="Connect dejectedness and expiate" width="326" height="19" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5228" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Dejectedness-to-expiate.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Dejectedness to expiate" title="Dejectedness to expiate" width="500" height="81" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5229" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Heterosexuality&rdquo; and &ldquo;heterosexualism&rdquo; are obviously synonyms, but &ldquo;nonrecreational&rdquo; and &ldquo;mulishness&rdquo; are not related, so we have two more distinct cases here:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Connect-mulishness-and-heterosexuality.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Connect mulishness and heterosexuality" title="Connect mulishness and heterosexuality" width="371" height="20" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5230" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Mulishness-to-heterosexuality.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Mulishness to heterosexuality" title="Mulishness to heterosexuality" width="500" height="82" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5231" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Connect-nonrecreational-and-heterosexuality.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Connect nonrecreational and heterosexuality" title="Connect nonrecreational and heterosexuality" width="408" height="23" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5232" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/Nonrecreational-to-heterosexuality.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Nonrecreational to heterosexuality" title="Nonrecreational to heterosexuality" width="500" height="80" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5233" /></p>
<p>There is another way to look at this. Instead of looking for the longest shortest path, we could look for the longest longest path. Of course we could go round in circles forever, so we probably want the longest chain that only visits each word once. If such a tour exists for our subgraph, then we can find it with <tt>FindHamiltonianCycle</tt>, but a quick test shows that there is no such path.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/HamiltonianGraph.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="HamiltonianGraphQ" title="HamiltonianGraphQ" width="310" height="21" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5234" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/03/No-such-path.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="No such path" title="No such path" width="95" height="22" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5235" /></p>
<p>So the challenge would be to find the largest Hamiltonian subgraph of this graph. Since the result will probably form a synonym chain that is thousands of words long, and too big for this blog, I will leave that as a challenge to the reader!</p>

Copyright © 2011 http://jtonedm.com James Taylor<br><br /><p>As promised when I was <a href="../../../../../../2011/03/23/omg-decision-model-notation-importance-of-decisions/">blogging from the Object Management Group standards meeting</a>, I caught up with OpenRules recently. <a href="../../../../../../2011/03/23/omg-decision-model-notation-importance-of-decisions/">OpenRules</a> was founded in 2003 by people who had previously developed a business rules management system. Their immediate focus was on business analysts and on empowering subject matter experts to build business rules with minimal IT involvement. Two things came out of this focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>No proprietary “Excel-like” UI:  they decided to use Microsoft Excel directly as their rules editing environment</li>
<li>No proprietary rule language:  they built on Java</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenRules business model is “professional open source” so revenue comes from support and consulting while the product is open sourced. The open source product is downloaded thousands of times per month and the company has been profitable since 2006. The company has remained small, focusing on development, support , and consulting. Their customers include large corporations like Thomson Reuters,  Commerzbank, , RBS, and Fiserv, government agencies like IRS and the European Patent Office, health care providers, and many online businesses.  OpenRules cooperates with leading research centers such as the <a href="http://4c.ucc.ie/">Cork Constraint Computation Centre</a> (4C) to develop new components.</p>
<p>OpenRules have added support for finite state machines, predictive analytics and optimization to their Business Rules Management System and now position it as a Decision Management System (a term I prefer).. The product has a repository integrated with the various decision management components.</p>
<p>With OpenRules 6 they implemented the KPI Decision Model approach (there’s a <a href="http://openrules.com/decision_model_primer.htm">primer</a> on how OpenRules implements the Decision Model on the OpenRules site). KPI Decision Model Rule Families can be typed directly into Excel, laid out with condition and conclusion columns as defined in the approach. OpenRules continues to also support a more compact but less rigorous decision table approach.</p>
<p>The basic approach in OpenRules is to allow business users to manage rules directly in Excel, OpenOffice or Google Docs (allowing collaborative rules management). Rulebooks contain RuleSheets which contain different types of decision tables such as KPI Rule Families. There are special tables that allow a user to define decisions and sub-decisions. Other Excel sheets contain a glossary &#8211; a set of fact definitions – and each fact name is linked to a business concept and mapped to a technical attribute name to support implementation. To support testing, other blocks of cells in Excel can be used to define new data types and example records. Finally decision objects are defined that map business concepts to object definitions. All these are different tables managed within multiple Excel Rulebooks that can be located in a local file system, a web server, a database, or can be created dynamically from a custom GUI. Rulebooks can be managed in the OpenRules repository with check-in/check-out and versioning at the Rulebook level. The repository allows advanced searches supported by Excel and related tools but little or no impact analysis in terms of database changes and their impact on rules – users can obviously do a lot in Excel, however, as Excel functionality remains available.</p>
<p>An ability to use Java snippets directly within Excel cells provides rules developers with the power of Java. The good news is this is very flexible and allows standard Java to be used (along with third party packages, if then logic, JDBC access and more) but obviously the bad news is the same – anything can be done in Java! Striking the right balance to keep complexity out of the Excel spreadsheets without writing a lot of code was clearly critical when using OpenRules.  To hide Java snippets from business users, a few years ago OpenRules introduced a powerful templatization mechanism that allowed business people to write rules without Java snippets but based on templates created with help of software developers. With OpenRules 6 there is no need for Java snippets: business analysts can use Excel tables to define Decision Models, related Rule Families, and test cases. These Decision Models an be executed and tested directly.</p>
<p>OpenRules also has a <a href="http://openrules.com/ord.htm">Rule Dialog</a> builder (that is being used by the folks at <a href="../../../../../../2010/11/30/first-look-general-intelletics/">General Intelletics</a> for instance) to build rules-based web questionnaires that capture data based on rules about required data, implications of data entered already etc. Like the rules themselves, everything is defined in Excel sheets. Users generally start with an example and then adapt or edit it. For each rule dialog there is a list of pages, a list of sections and a list of questions &#8211; the pages list the sections included and the sections list the questions. Dialogs can also have definitions of which page to go to in various conditions and rules can be defined to hide or show sections/questions, add/remove answers to available answers etc. Excel is used to manage drop downs such as lists of available questions, allowed answers etc. Rule dialog provides templates for page navigation rules, for automatically defining auto-responses based on already entered answers to other questions, for input validation, and more.</p>
<p>The overall environment looks very intuitive for a non technical user (it works just like other Excel spreadsheets) but obviously keeping everything consistent in Excel has challenges once you start editing extensively. Some problems will only show at compile time but there is an Eclipse plug in to allow developers to check an Excel file for errors. The automatically generated rules-based web interface can be deployed to a web server like Tomcat or WebSphere. You can see and <a href="http://openrules.com/download.htm">download</a> demos such as the 1040EZ application from the OpenRules website.</p>
<p>OpenRules also offer a constrained-based solver for solving complex optimization problems and a rule learner for predictive analytics. I hope to publish an update on this soon.</p>

From Reuters: <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42715641">Toyota: Output to Return to Normal in November or December</a> <br />
<blockquote>Toyota Motor said it expects its production to make a full recovery by November or December ... Toyota and other Japanese automakers have been hit hard by a supply disruption of mostly electronic and resin-based parts made in Japan's northeast</blockquote>Several tech companies have said supply chain issues will impact Q2. As an example, from the Western Digital conference call this week: <br />
<blockquote>[T]here is uncertainty around the ability of our customers and the HDD industry to fully satisfy this demand due to Supply Chain challenges ... <b>we believe that we'll be supply constrained in both June quarter and in the September quarter</b>. We think that in the December quarter, it will be, we'll be able to supply pretty much what the industry, what the customers demand so we think that the comfort level as far as inventory in the pipeline will not be able to be reached again until this quarter next year, the March quarter of next year</blockquote>This will be an issue most of the year, although most of the impact for the U.S. in Q2 and a little in Q3. I've seen estimates that supply issues will be a drag on U.S. GDP growth of about 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points in Q2 and probably less in Q3.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Link to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculatedriskblog</a>!<img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10004977-1411971220014176301?l=www.calculatedriskblog.com' alt='' /></div></div>

<div>Description: <p><img alt="cascade_nytimes.jpg" src="http://infosthetics.com/archives/cascade_nytimes.jpg" width="600" height="300" class="mt-image-none" style="" /><br />
What happens if you bring together <a href="http://www.blprnt.com/">Jer Thorp</a>, known of many beautiful data representations, and <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cocteau/">Mark Hansen</a>, UCLA statistics professor and one of the people behind the <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2007/11/moveable_type_flowing_news_at_nytimes.html">Moveable Type installation</a>, together at the <a href="http://nytlabs.com/">NYTLabs</a>, which is the research and development lab of The New York Times Company.</p>

<p>Well, you get <a href="http://nytlabs.com/projects/cascade.html">Cascade</a> [nytlabs.com], a 3D interactive visualization tool that reveals how information propagates through social media space by linking the browsing behavior on the NYTimes website with the corresponding social activity in terms of content and URL sharing. In short, the tool aims to reveal the causal factors that determine how tweets about news stories are propagated in the most succesful ways. For instance, the visualization already can demonstrate how viral popularity is mostly influenced by the people who are followed by famous people, who in turn drive a lot of online discussions and retweet activity.</p>

<p>The "side view" shows a 2D bar-graph-like timeline of the activities of a specific story (e.g. shortening of links (blue), tweeting (red), etc.), which can also be explored in 3D, as the radius depicts the time passed since the original news story broke. The yellow sunburst-like "radar view" reveals the separation between individual conversations. The resulting "cascades" can also be further explored to focus only on the most influential tweets (the "backbone of a conversation"), and the specific users who posted them. As a result, the tool is able to display the overall life cycle of a news sharing event, and identify the most influential contributors that drive and influence this cycle. </p>

What happens if you bring together <a href="http://www.blprnt.com/">Jer Thorp</a>, known of many beautiful data representations, and <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cocteau/">Mark Hansen</a>, UCLA statistics professor and one of the people behind the <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2007/11/moveable_type_flowing_news_at_nytimes.html">Moveable Type installation</a>, together at the <a href="http://nytlabs.com/">NYTLabs</a>, which is the research and development lab of The New York Times Company.</p>

<p>Well, you get <a href="http://nytlabs.com/projects/cascade.html">Cascade</a> [nytlabs.com], a 3D interactive visualization tool that reveals how information propagates through social media space by linking the browsing behavior on the NYTimes website with the corresponding social activity in terms of content and URL sharing. In short, the tool aims to reveal the causal factors that determine how tweets about news stories are propagated in the most succesful ways. For instance, the visualization already can demonstrate how viral popularity is mostly influenced by the people who are followed by famous people, who in turn drive a lot of online discussions and retweet activity.</p>

<p>The "side view" shows a 2D bar-graph-like timeline of the activities of a specific story (e.g. shortening of links (blue), tweeting (red), etc.), which can also be explored in 3D, as the radius depicts the time passed since the original news story broke. The yellow sunburst-like "radar view" reveals the separation between individual conversations. The resulting "cascades" can also be further explored to focus only on the most influential tweets (the "backbone of a conversation"), and the specific users who posted them. As a result, the tool is able to display the overall life cycle of a news sharing event, and identify the most influential contributors that drive and influence this cycle. </p>

        <p>I recently learned we have some readers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration so I thought I'd share an old story.</p>

<p>About 35 years ago my brother worked briefly as a clerk at NOAA in their D.C. (or maybe it was D.C.-area) office.  His job was to enter the weather numbers that came in.  He had a boss who was very orderly.  At one point there was a hurricane that wiped out some weather station in the Caribbean, and his boss told him to put in the numbers anyway.  My brother protested that they didn't have the data, to which his boss replied: "I know what the numbers are."</p>

<p>Nowadays we call this sort of thing "imputation" and we like it.  But not in the raw data!   I bet nowadays they have an NA code.</p>

Here is a [blog-ified] version of my book review.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>T</strong>his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1420079336?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrprobboo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1420079336">book</a> is the second (blue) edition of a successful (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584885394?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrprobboo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1584885394">violet</a>) handbook that can benefit a wide audience interested in using R for its data analysis.  (After I wrote the review, I saw this <a href="http://www.programmingr.com/content/handbook-statistical-analyses-using-r-everitt-and-hothorn-2006">appropriate analysis</a> of the first edition.) It covers most of non-Bayesian statistical methods, with forays into exploratory data analysis with tools like principal components, clustering and bagging/boosting. As reflected in the long list of chapters, the coverage is quite extensive and only missing specialised statistical domains like time-series (apart from longitudinal data), econometrics (except for generalised linear models), and signal processing. Beside the absence of a Bayesian perspective (only mentioned in connection with BIC and the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mclust/index.html">mclust</a> package, while the Bayesian formalism would be a natural tool for analysing mixed models), I miss some material on simulation, the only entry found in the book being bootstrap (pages 153-154).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>G</strong>iven its title and emphasis on analyses, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1420079336?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrprobboo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1420079336">book</a> is logically associated with an R package <a title="HSAUR2" href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HSAUR2/index.html">HSAUR2</a> <em>[if there is an intended pun, I missed it!] </em>and works according to a fixed pattern: each chapter (1) starts with a description of a few datasets, (2) summarises the statistical main issues in one or two pages, and then (3) engages into an R analysis. As the complexity increases with the chapter number, the authors are relying more and more on specialised packages that need to be downloaded by the reader. I have no objection with this pedagogical choice, especially when considering that the packages are mostly recent. I would however have like a bit more details about those packages or at least about their main function, as the reader is left to experiment solely from the line of code provided in the handbook. (In contrast, a few passages are a bit &#8220;geeky&#8221; and require a deeper understanding of R objects than casual readers master. Also, using <em>layout</em> instead of <em>par(mfrow=&#8230;</em> is not that obvious.) My only criticism of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1420079336?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrprobboo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1420079336">book</a> at this level is the puzzling insistence on including all the datasets used therein in the form of tables. I frankly fail to see the point in spending so many pages on those tables given that they all are available from the <a title="HSAUR2" href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HSAUR2/index.html">HSAUR2</a> package. A page of further explanation, of background or of statistical theory would have been much more beneficial to any reader, in my opinion! The same criticism applies to the few exercises found at the end of each chapter. (The most glaring use of a table occurs in the graphical display chapter, of course! The authors rely on a dataset about the 50 north-American States and list the data instead of illustrating the use of a map&#8230;.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I</strong>n conclusion, I find the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1420079336?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrprobboo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1420079336">book</a> by Everitt and Hothorn quite pleasant and bound to fit its purpose. The layout and presentation is nice (with a single noticeable mishap on page 332 caused by Darwin&#8217;s tree of life.) It should appeal to all readers as it contains a wealth of information about the use of R for statistical analysis. Included seasoned R users: When reading the first chapters, I found myself scribbling small light-bulbs in the margin to point out features of R I was not aware of. (In particular, the authors mentioned the option <em>type=&#8221;n&#8221;</em> for <em>plot</em> that <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers</a> signalled as the most useful option for plotting.) In addition, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1420079336?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrprobboo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1420079336">book</a> is quite handy for a crash introduction to statistics for (well-enough motivated) non-statisticians.<em> (This post has also appeared on<strong><a href="http://statisticsforum.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/review-of-a-handbook-of-statistical-analyses-using-r/"> Statistical Forum</a></strong> on April 20.)</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I recently came across a very elegant way of saying that in a certain sense the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering" target="_blank">k-means clustering algorithm</a> is guaranteed to converge. I thought this was something worthy of sharing. Before I do that, <strong>for the sake of completeness I will (like in other posts on the blog) just summarize k-means and not assume any background</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_2743" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 275px"><a href="http://onionesquereality.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/metastabilitc3a0-stabilitc3a0.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2743" title="Metastabilità-stabilità" src="http://onionesquereality.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/metastabilitc3a0-stabilitc3a0.png?w=265&#038;h=175" alt="" width="265" height="175" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">stabilità</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Short Introduction:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">k-means clustering in a way is the most commonly used machine learning algorithm in my opinion (not just clustering algorithm). Its popularity is perhaps a function of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Importance of clustering in data analysis across domains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ease of implementation of k-means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is another story though that little is known about it theoretically. This is something I seriously intend to write about in future posts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Clustering: </strong>The idea of clustering is to find structure in the data. Given a dataset, the task of clustering is to find groups in this set, such that &#8220;similar&#8221; points are in one group and &#8220;dissimilar&#8221; ones in others. In k-means clustering, this notion of similarity is usually the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance" target="_blank">Euclidean Distance</a>. The Algorithm roughly is like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:60px;">1. Choose a value of &#8220;k&#8221; i.e number of clusters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:60px;">2. Initialize k cluster centroids in the data-set randomly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:60px;">3. For each point in the data, find the Euclidean Distance with each of the cluster centroids initialized in step &#8211; 2.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:60px;">4. Assign each point in the data-set to a cluster centroid it is closest to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:60px;">5. Update each cluster centroid in step 2 with the average of all points assigned to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:60px;">6. Repeat steps 2 &#8211; 5 till convergence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Optimization Function: </strong>Informally, the objective of k-means can be said to be: Find a set of cluster centroids such that all points in that &#8220;cluster&#8221; are the closest to that centroid than to any other. i.e. Find cluster centroids such that the sum of distances of all points with their assigned cluster centroids is as low as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This optimization objective is to minimize the distortion function:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+J%28c%2C+%5Cmu%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi+%3D+1%7D%5Em+%5ClVert+x%5E%7B%28i%29%7D+-+%5Cmu_%7Bc%5E%7B%28i%29%7D%7D%5CrVert%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;displaystyle J(c, &#92;mu) = &#92;sum_{i = 1}^m &#92;lVert x^{(i)} - &#92;mu_{c^{(i)}}&#92;rVert^2' title='&#92;displaystyle J(c, &#92;mu) = &#92;sum_{i = 1}^m &#92;lVert x^{(i)} - &#92;mu_{c^{(i)}}&#92;rVert^2' class='latex' /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where, <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu_c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;mu_c' title='&#92;mu_c' class='latex' /> is a cluster centroid to which a point <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='x' title='x' class='latex' /> is assigned to. Note: k-means is simply <strong>co-ordinate descent</strong> on <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='J' title='J' class='latex' /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Convergence:</strong> It is not hard to see that the distortion function <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='J' title='J' class='latex' /> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function" target="_blank">non-convex</a>. And thus k-means is prone to finding local minimas. i.e One is not guaranteed to find the best clustering according to <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='J' title='J' class='latex' /> on a random initialization. Therefore, usually people initialize k-means randomly a few times and then pick the best solution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lyapunov Function:</strong> But we do know that k-means is quite &#8220;well behaved&#8221; usually. This is because k-means is guaranteed to converge in a certain sense. That is, in successive iterations of k-means <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='J' title='J' class='latex' /> <strong><em>decreases monotonically</em></strong> to a certain minimum value. It would never increase from one iteration to another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A way to formalize this notion is using the idea of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_function" target="_blank">Lyapunov Function</a> as [1]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. We can associate an &#8220;energy&#8221; with a given state of the kmeans algorithm by connecting a spring between each point and the centroid it is assigned to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The energy of each spring is proportional to its squared length.  i.e <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dkx%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='E = &#92;frac{1}{2}kx^2' title='E = &#92;frac{1}{2}kx^2' class='latex' />. Where x is the length of the spring. In this case the distance between the mean (centroid) and a point. This &#8220;k&#8221;, is the stiffness of the string and not the &#8220;k&#8221; of kmeans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The total energy of all such springs is a <em>Lyapunov Function</em> for the algorithm BECAUSE:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">(i) The assignment to a cluster centroid only happens if there is a decrease in energy. A point gets assigned to another cluster centroid only if its energy will decrease with such an assignment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">(ii) Each Iteration of updating centroids will only be such that the energy of the springs decreases. This is a method to minimize the energy of the springs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">(iii) This energy has a lower bound (the minima of <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='J' title='J' class='latex' />)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This discussion shows that this problem has a Lyapunov Function. And since it has a Lyapunov function it converges.</p>

do we use easy.py only for classification? how can we use it for regression?<br />
when i tried to use it for my data for regression, it gives best c and gamma but i think it does for classification because the predicts are -1 and 1</div>

<div>Content:
<div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">New customers.</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It's not easy to find new customers, is it?</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There are many, many methods for acquiring new customers.&nbsp; Let's think about a few methods.</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Buying Customers:</div><ul style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><li>This takes many different forms.&nbsp; Catalog marketers pay Abacus $0.06, +/-, to gain one-time access to a name/address, then mail a catalog to the customer.&nbsp; An online marketer pays Google $0.50 for clicks that appear after paying for the right to appear on a search page.&nbsp; A car company pays CBS $300,000 for a thirty-second commercial.&nbsp; Buying customers is easy, and it is costly.</li>
</ul><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Merchandise:</div><ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Think Verizon.&nbsp; They offer you a new product (the iPhone), and they steal market share from AT&amp;T.</span></li>
</ul><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Concepts:</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Eddie Bauer expands into Outlet stores in the 1990s, giving them access to a demographic/psychographic that wouldn't normally shop a full-price store.</span></li>
</ul><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Permission:</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You are reading this blog via permission, right?&nbsp; You subscribe via RSS or E-Mail, and as long as I don't mess up, you give me permission to continue to speak with you each week.&nbsp; Permission is a front-loaded marketing tactic ... you invest time instead of money, with the hope of long-term payback.&nbsp; Permission doesn't boost quarterly numbers, does it?</span></li>
</ul><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Channels:</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Microsoft expands into Retail stores in malls, offering products to customers that might not normally purchase the products.&nbsp; Expansion into channels can be expensive ... expansion into retail saddles one with debt.</span></li>
</ul><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Word of Mouth:</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This is the opposite of expansion into Retail.&nbsp; Retail, you see, is what I call a "high probability event".&nbsp; Open a store, customers arrive.&nbsp; Of course, you pay a dear price for access to a high probability event, often resulting in crippling debt.&nbsp; Word of Mouth is opposite, what I call a "low probability event".&nbsp; There is no "best practice" for something becoming viral ... for every Facebook, there are tens of thousands of social networks that may be better, but never gain traction.&nbsp; For every Angry Birds, there's thousands of games, many better, that go nowhere.&nbsp; For <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2LRROpph0">every Rebecca Black</a>, there's ten thousand artists with infinitely better music that go nowhere.</span></li>
</ul><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So much of what we're being taught today are methods to use technology to increase the likelihood of success in a low-probability event.&nbsp; If we just follow best practices, if we just use technology and be authentic and be great, if we just encourage "engagement", everything will take care of itself.&nbsp; Instead, all we are doing is improving the probability of success from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 950.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This is why the vast majority of people dabbling in social media report almost no success.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you want to acquire a new customer, consider the tactics available to you.&nbsp; Are you paying up-front with money?&nbsp; If so, you are likely to acquire a new customer, at significant cost.&nbsp; Are you paying up-front with time/permission?&nbsp; If so, you are not likely to have short-term success.&nbsp; Are you pursuing a low-probability event?&nbsp; If so, you are not likely to ever have success, but if success comes, it's gonna be fantastic!</span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/32202893-5250503313004556429?l=blog.minethatdata.com' alt='' /></div><div class="feedflare">

<div>Content:
Rajiv Sethi put up a nice <a href="http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/03/on-interpretation-of-prediction-market.html">post</a> on his blog, asking to what extent we can infer the nature of traders' beliefs about a particular event from the transactions that occur in a prediction market. (Related: my <a href="http://www.inherentuncertainty.org/2010/05/prediction-markets-and-learning.html">earlier post</a> on prediction markets) In responding to a post by Nate Silver at <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/a-graphical-overview-of-the-2012-republican-field/">fivethirtyeight</a>, who used data from prediction markets to discuss the electoral outcomes, Rajiv says:<div><blockquote>This interpretation of prices as probabilities is common and will be repeated frequently over the coming months. But what could the "perceived likelihood according to the market" possibly mean?<br /><br />Markets don't have perceptions. Traders do, but there is considerable heterogeneity in trader beliefs at any point in time. Prediction market prices contain valuable information about this distribution of beliefs, but there is no basis for the common presumption that the price at last trade represents the beliefs of a hypothetical average trader in any meaningful sense. In fact, to make full use of market data to make inferences about the distribution of beliefs, one needs to look beyond the price at last trade and examine the entire order book...<br /><br />All that the price at last trade can tell us about is the beliefs of the two parties to this transaction. If both are risk-averse or risk-neutral, they each must believe that entering their respective positions will yield a positive expected return. Hence the buyer must assign probability at least 62.5% to the event that the Democrat is elected, while the seller assigns a likelihood of at most 62.5% to this event.<br /><br />This tells us nothing about the beliefs of traders who are not party to this transaction.</blockquote><br />Rajiv goes on to post an example order book (for the US presidential election outcome for 2012), and he discusses some conclusions that could be drawn from this data. In a <a href="http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/03/from-order-books-to-belief.html">followup post</a>, Rajiv notes: <blockquote>In contrast, the order book, which is the collection of all unexpired bids and offers that cannot currently be matched against each other, contains a wealth of information about the distribution of trader beliefs. Under certain assumptions about the risk preferences of market participants, one can deduce a distribution of trader beliefs from this collection of standing orders. The imputed distribution may then be used to infer what the average trader (in a well-defined sense) perceives the likelihood of the underlying event to be. Furthermore, it can be used to gauge the extent of disagreement about this likelihood within the trading population.</blockquote><div><br /></div>I'd like to make a couple of comments about this line of reasoning. First, I disagree with Rajiv that price of the last trade is a poor indicator of the consensus probability. The statement that the last trade "tells us nothing about the beliefs of traders who are not party to this transaction" is simply not true: the exchange mechanism was designed was to match orders whose desired prices overlap, and up until the last trade we can assume that the mechanism did its job. So the two parties to this transaction were not arbitrary -- each party represents the "marginal" trader on their respective side of the bet. The transaction does not just represent the beliefs of these two individuals, it also tells us that there was a group of less-confident traders waiting behind whose trades were not matched. This is very important information.</div><div><br /></div><div>(<b>Update:</b> After emailing a link to this post to Rajiv, he responded and wanted to correct the record: </div><div><blockquote>I did not say that the price at last trade "is a poor indicator of the consensus probability," only that "there is no basis for the common presumption that the price at last trade represents the beliefs of a hypothetical average trader in any meaningful sense." It's an important difference. My <a href="http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/03/from-order-books-to-belief.html">follow up post</a> shows that the price can be a pretty good approximation if the order book is reasonably symmetric.</blockquote></div><div>Thanks, I stand corrected!)</div><div><br /></div><div>Second, while the order book provides "promises" by other traders to take a side of the bet, these promises are very weak. For example, when a trader posts an order in the order book, this trader is exposed to the risk that news is released that moves the presumed likelihood of the outcome, and other traders with fast reactions can buy up these still-cheap orders. Hence, if we interpret posted orders as statements about beliefs, then these estimates will be biased according to this potential risk. Rajiv makes this point as well.</div><div><br /></div><div>It should be noted also that traders can manipulate the order book maliciously. Since posting orders is free, a trader can lay down a large buy order and then, perhaps via a trading bot, pull the order after any change in the price. Depending on Intrade's mechanism, say if the company were to announce the clearing of every individual contract, this would allow traders to post orders in an entirely risk-free manner. (I don't know the precise details of the mechanism, but clearly some risk is required if the market can clear a large order all at once). </div><div><br /></div><div>(During the health care debate, the market for contracts "Will Obamacare pass?" was likely manipulated, as you can see <a href="http://gawker.com/#!5495665/is-someone-manipulating-intrades-healthcare-reform-market">here</a>. In this case, an individual trader made a huge bet against passage, moving the price more than 40 points. The market quickly recovered.)</div><div><br /></div><div>This also gets at something that's bothered me for a long time: why is it that the "typical" mechanism for trading such betting contracts is to run an exchange with a posted order book? Despite the fact that this is how the stock market operates, I see no reason that this should be the gold standard. Recent research in prediction markets has led to the design of <i>automated market makers</i> which possess some very nice properties. In particular, they don't involve an order book, and instead require the market maker to simply post the current prices -- the bets placed by traders will move the prices according to an advertised "potential function." Under simple conditions, it can be shown that the market maker has a bounded risk to operate this market, and that this risk scales according to the amount of "liquidty" it provides. For such a market, the liquidity is essentially the speed with which the prices move according to the size of a given trade.</div><div><br /></div><div>With an automated market maker of this type, much of Rajiv's concerns, i.e. those regarding how to translate between trades/orders and beliefs, are no longer relevant. The prices posted by the market maker contain all the relevant information about the status of the contracts.</div><div><br /></div><div>(Interested individuals can have a look at <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jake/ec041-abernethy.pdf">my upcoming EC paper</a>, with Jenn Wortman Vaughan and Yiling Chen, on designing automated market makers for combinatorial events spaces)</div><div><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1106308362982890799-8361432921631851004?l=www.inherentuncertainty.org' alt='' /></div></div>

This was amusing.   Greece is probing an email discussion of a possible default.  The Financial Times has the Citi email sent on Wednesday: <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e1b8d8a2-6c28-11e0-b36e-00144feab49a.html">Greece probes market talk of debt restructuring</a><blockquote>“Over the last 20min, there seems to be some increased noise over [Greek] debt restructuring as early as this Easter weekend. Spreads are moving wider now with 2-year spread +100 from +35 mid-day, while [Greek] banks are at -4%, i6% vs +2% in the morning.<br />
<br />
“The last few days the talks over [Greek] restructuring/rescheduling have intensified, despite the ongoing denials by [Greek] and foreign officials.<br />
<br />
“If a credit event takes place it is crucial to see what the terms would be as a haircut would have a much different outcome vs an extension of maturities.”</blockquote>Geesh - that seems like pretty normal speculation!<br />
<br />
The yield on Greece ten year bonds increased to 14.9% today and the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GGGB2YR:IND">two year yield</a> is up to 23%.  Sounds like a credit event might happen soon.  If so, I wonder if it will be haircut or an extension of maturities?<br />
<br />
Here are the ten year yields for <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GIGB10YR:IND&amp;n=y">Ireland</a> up to a record 10.5%, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GSPT10YR:IND&amp;n=y">Portugal</a> up to a record 9.5%, and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GSPG10YR:IND&amp;n=y">Spain</a> at 5.5%.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Link to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculatedriskblog</a>!<img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10004977-2550013903829577083?l=www.calculatedriskblog.com' alt='' /></div></div>

<div>Content:
<p>The latest update to <a href="http://d8taplex.com" target="_self">d8taplex</a> includes a new crawl of <a href="http://d8taplex.com/?query=host:www.stat.go.jp" target="_self">www.stat.go.jp</a> - the Japanese statistics agency. This brings the number of time series on the site to more than 400k.</p>
<p>My all time favourite fish for nigiri-sushi is sardine (iwashi/いわし). This fish is not so popular in the UK or America. In recent years I've found it less available in Japan and the statistics below - which track the quantity of fish caught in tons - clearly shows the sardine catch declining after a peak in the '80s.</p>

</div>
<p>Of course, the gotcha here is that this graph shows the national catch - not the importing of fish, the exporting of fish, nor the consumption of fish by type. I'll pull together those numbers and present the complete picture in subsequent posts.</p><div class="feedflare">

The exact same Taylorist time-and-motion study tools were applied (in fact, in the 30s this was so popular that women&#8217;s magazines carried articles about time-and-motion in the kitchen.

<p> The Laplacian is a linear translation-invariant operator, and as such is necessarily diagonalised by the Fourier transform

<p> Indeed, we have

<p>
Because of this explicit diagonalisation, it is a straightforward manner to define spectral multipliers <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%28-%5CDelta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{m(-&#92;Delta)}' title='{m(-&#92;Delta)}' class='latex' /> of the Laplacian for any (measurable, polynomial growth) function <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%3A+%5B0%2C%2B%5Cinfty%29+%5Crightarrow+%7B%5Cbf+C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{m: [0,+&#92;infty) &#92;rightarrow {&#92;bf C}}' title='{m: [0,+&#92;infty) &#92;rightarrow {&#92;bf C}}' class='latex' />, by the formula </p>

<p> (The presence of the minus sign in front of the Laplacian has some minor technical advantages, as it makes <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-%5CDelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{-&#92;Delta}' title='{-&#92;Delta}' class='latex' /> positive semi-definite. One can also define spectral multipliers more abstractly from general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_calculus">functional calculus</a>, after establishing that the Laplacian is essentially self-adjoint.)

Each of these families of multipliers are related to the others, by means of various integral transforms (and also, in some cases, by analytic continuation). For instance:

<li> Using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform">Laplace transform</a>, one can express (sufficiently smooth) multipliers in terms of heat operators. For instance, using the identity
<p align="center"><img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clambda%5E%7Bs%2F2%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5CGamma%28-s%2F2%29%7D+%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty+t%5E%7B-1-s%2F2%7D+e%5E%7B-t%5Clambda%7D%5C+dt&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;displaystyle  &#92;lambda^{s/2} = &#92;frac{1}{&#92;Gamma(-s/2)} &#92;int_0^&#92;infty t^{-1-s/2} e^{-t&#92;lambda}&#92; dt' title='&#92;displaystyle  &#92;lambda^{s/2} = &#92;frac{1}{&#92;Gamma(-s/2)} &#92;int_0^&#92;infty t^{-1-s/2} e^{-t&#92;lambda}&#92; dt' class='latex' /></p>
<p> (using analytic continuation if necessary to make the right-hand side well-defined), with <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{&#92;Gamma}' title='{&#92;Gamma}' class='latex' /> being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>, we can write the fractional derivative operators in terms of heat kernels: <a name="Frac">
<p align="center"><img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28-%5CDelta%29%5E%7Bs%2F2%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5CGamma%28-s%2F2%29%7D+%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty+t%5E%7B-1-s%2F2%7D+e%5E%7Bt%5CDelta%7D%5C+dt.+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;displaystyle  (-&#92;Delta)^{s/2} = &#92;frac{1}{&#92;Gamma(-s/2)} &#92;int_0^&#92;infty t^{-1-s/2} e^{t&#92;Delta}&#92; dt. &#92; &#92; &#92; &#92; &#92; (1)' title='&#92;displaystyle  (-&#92;Delta)^{s/2} = &#92;frac{1}{&#92;Gamma(-s/2)} &#92;int_0^&#92;infty t^{-1-s/2} e^{t&#92;Delta}&#92; dt. &#92; &#92; &#92; &#92; &#92; (1)' class='latex' /></p>
<p></a> </li>
<li> Using analytic continuation, one can connect heat operators <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7Bt%5CDelta%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{e^{t&#92;Delta}}' title='{e^{t&#92;Delta}}' class='latex' /> to Schr&ouml;dinger operators <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7Bit%5CDelta%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{e^{it&#92;Delta}}' title='{e^{it&#92;Delta}}' class='latex' />, a process also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wick_rotation">Wick rotation</a>. Analytic continuation is a notoriously unstable process, and so it is difficult to use analytic continuation to obtain any quantitative estimates on (say) Schr&ouml;dinger operators from their heat counterparts; however, this procedure can be useful for propagating <em>identities</em> from one family to another. For instance, one can derive the fundamental solution for the Schr&ouml;dinger equation from the fundamental solution for the heat equation by this method. </li>
<li> Using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_inversion_theorem">Fourier inversion formula</a>, one can write general multipliers as integral combinations of Schr&ouml;dinger or wave propagators; for instance, if <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{z}' title='{z}' class='latex' /> lies in the upper half plane <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+H%7D+%3A%3D+%5C%7B+z+%5Cin+%7B%5Cbf+C%7D%3A+%5Chbox%7BIm%7D+z+%3E+0+%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{{&#92;bf H} := &#92;{ z &#92;in {&#92;bf C}: &#92;hbox{Im} z &gt; 0 &#92;}}' title='{{&#92;bf H} := &#92;{ z &#92;in {&#92;bf C}: &#92;hbox{Im} z &gt; 0 &#92;}}' class='latex' />,, one has

Because of these relationships, it is possible (in principle, at least), to leverage one&#8217;s understanding one family of spectral multipliers to gain control on another family of multipliers. For instance, the fact that the heat operators <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7Bt%5CDelta%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{e^{t&#92;Delta}}' title='{e^{t&#92;Delta}}' class='latex' /> have non-negative kernel (a fact which can be seen from the maximum principle, or from the Brownian motion interpretation of the heat kernels) implies (by <a href="#Frac">(1)</a>) that the fractional integral operators <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28-%5CDelta%29%5E%7B-s%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{(-&#92;Delta)^{-s/2}}' title='{(-&#92;Delta)^{-s/2}}' class='latex' /> for <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{s&gt;0}' title='{s&gt;0}' class='latex' /> also have non-negative kernel. Or, the fact that the wave equation enjoys finite speed of propagation (and hence that the wave propagators <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccos%28t%5Csqrt%7B-%5CDelta%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{&#92;cos(t&#92;sqrt{-&#92;Delta})}' title='{&#92;cos(t&#92;sqrt{-&#92;Delta})}' class='latex' /> have distributional convolution kernel localised to the ball of radius <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7Ct%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{|t|}' title='{|t|}' class='latex' /> centred at the origin), can be used (by <a href="#rk">(3)</a>) to show that the resolvents <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28k%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{R(k^2)}' title='{R(k^2)}' class='latex' /> have a convolution kernel that is essentially localised to the ball of radius <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28+1+%2F+%7C%5CIm%28k%29%7C+%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{O( 1 / |&#92;Im(k)| )}' title='{O( 1 / |&#92;Im(k)| )}' class='latex' /> around the origin.

(In general dimension, explicit formulas are still available, but involve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function">Bessel functions</a>.

We prove this theorem below the fold. As observed <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=190801">long ago by Kato</a> (and also reproduced below), this estimate is equivalent (via a Fourier transform in the spectral variable <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{&#92;lambda}' title='{&#92;lambda}' class='latex' />) to a useful estimate for the free Schr&ouml;dinger equation known as the <em>local smoothing estimate</em>, which in particular implies the well-known <em>RAGE theorem</em> for that equation; it also has similar consequences for the free wave equation. As we shall see, it also encodes some spectral information about the Laplacian; for instance, it can be used to show that the Laplacian has no eigenvalues, resonances, or singular continuous spectrum. These spectral facts are already obvious from the Fourier transform representation of the Laplacian, but the point is that the limiting absorption principle also applies to more general operators for which the explicit diagonalisation afforded by the Fourier transform is not available. (Igor Rodnianski and I are working on a paper regarding this topic, of which I hope to say more about soon.)

In order to illustrate the main ideas and suppress technical details, I will be a little loose with some of the rigorous details of the arguments, and in particular will be manipulating limits and integrals at a somewhat formal level.

On the other hand, from local smoothing we know that <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cint_T%5E%7BT%2B1%7D+%5C%7Ce%5E%7Bit%5CDelta%7D%5C%7C_%7BL%5E2%28K%29%7D%5C+dt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{&#92;int_T^{T+1} &#92;|e^{it&#92;Delta}&#92;|_{L^2(K)}&#92; dt}' title='{&#92;int_T^{T+1} &#92;|e^{it&#92;Delta}&#92;|_{L^2(K)}&#92; dt}' class='latex' /> goes to zero as <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT+%5Crightarrow+%5Cpm+%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{T &#92;rightarrow &#92;pm &#92;infty}' title='{T &#92;rightarrow &#92;pm &#92;infty}' class='latex' />. Putting the two facts together we obtain the claim. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;Box' title='&#92;Box' class='latex' /></p>

There is also a similar RAGE theorem for the wave equation (with <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{L^2}' title='{L^2}' class='latex' /> replaced by the energy space <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%5E1+%5Ctimes+L%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='{H^1 &#92;times L^2}' title='{H^1 &#92;times L^2}' class='latex' />) whose precise statement we omit here.

<p align="center"><b> &mdash;  6. The limiting amplitude principle  &mdash; </b></p>
<p>
A close cousin to the limiting absorption principle, which governs the limiting behaviour of the resolvent as it approaches the spectrum, is the <em>limiting amplitude principle</em>, which governs the asymptotic behaviour of a Schr&ouml;dinger or wave equation with oscillating forcing term. We give this principle for the Schr&ouml;dinger equation (the case for the wave equation is analogous):

Hey,<br />
I have recently started using Libsvm to solve a multi class class imbalance problem I am currently pursuing. The description is as follows:<br />
I currently have a 4 class medical data mining problem each class indicating a stage of the disease {normals, suspects, intermediate stage, extreme stage}. The number of data points in each class are {1223, 488, 130, 61} respectively and my objective is to predict accurately for the last two classes. Using libsvm I understand that we can adopt two methods:<br />
1) Changing grid.py to use as an evaluation function specificity/recall as measures instead of total accuracy.<br />
2) Changing the weights in the misclassification costs.<br />
<br />
On further reading up I understand that the libsvm tools are available for 1) but for only a binary-classification problem.<br />
And there is no algorithm mentioned anywhere in order for me to find ideal weights in case of the misclassification costs.<br />
<br />
Are there any other methods available or the above the only methods? If not libsvm is there a better tool for me to use to handle this problem?<br />
Could you please enlighten me as to what would be an appropriate way to go about handling this problem? Any help/direction in this regard would be really awesome.<br />

Hey,<br />
Hey,<br />
I have recently started using Libsvm to solve a multi class class imbalance problem I am currently pursuing. The description is as follows:<br />
I currently have a 4 class medical data mining problem each class indicating a stage of the disease {normals, suspects, intermediate stage, extreme stage}. The number of data points in each class are {1223, 488, 130, 61} respectively and my objective is to predict accurately for the last two classes. Using libsvm I understand that we can adopt two methods:<br />
1) Changing grid.py to use as an evaluation function specificity/recall as measures instead of total accuracy.<br />
2) Changing the weights in the misclassification costs.<br />

<div>Content:
When the Philly Fed <a href="http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2011/bos0411.cfm">business outlook report</a> was released this morning, I made several points:<br />
• The index showed slower expansion in April than in March.<br />
• This was below expectations, but ...<br />
• This index showed decent growth in April, and this suggests the ISM index will be in the low 60s for April.<br />
<br />
Several readers have sent me other reports arguing the Philly Fed report suggests, well, the end of the world or something. That is wrong.<br />
<br />
First, the Philly Fed index is noisy month-to-month.<br />
<br />
Second, the reading of 18.5 is above the median during expansions for the last 40 years. The median during expansions is 14.<br />
<br />
Third, the reading in March was the highest since January 1984 - and a decline was expected (although this reading was below expectations).<br />
<br />
Here is a long term graph of the index:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://calculatedriskimages.blogspot.com/2011/04/philly-fed-index-april-2011.html" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1090,height=770,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Philly Fed" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fm1JUEjoh-M/TbCj-TBqsmI/AAAAAAAAKLM/A4WNk-toRc0/s320/PhillyFedIndexLongApr2011.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> <i><b><span style="font-size: 85%;">Click on graph for larger image.</span></b></i><br />
<br />
Obviously this index is noisy, and this is just one month. Still a reading of 18.5 shows decent expansion, not the end of the world as we know it.<br />
<br />
Because this index is noisy, I average it with the NY Fed (Empire state) each month. Remember the <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/empire-state-manufacturing-survey.html">NY Fed index</a> showed faster expansion in April, and was at the highest level in a year.<br />
<br />
Then I average both the Philly Fed and NY Fed indexes with several other regional surveys - and that helps predict the ISM manufacturing index.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Manufacturing#category=Manufacturing&amp;chart=ISMFedAprilPrelim.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1090,height=770,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="ISM PMI" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QXeqxiRO6Ug/TbA49k2fsbI/AAAAAAAAKLE/aUtelAN8YRM/s320/ISMFedAprilPrelim.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> This graph compares the regional Fed surveys and the ISM manufacturing index. The dashed green line is an average of the NY Fed (Empire State) and Philly Fed surveys through April. The ISM and total Fed surveys are through March.<br />
<br />
And what does a 60 reading for the ISM mean? Here is a long term graph of the ISM manufacturing index:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Manufacturing#category=Manufacturing&amp;chart=ISMmfgMarch2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1090,height=770,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="ISM PMI" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VaYldxQDEMY/TZX-VCJLO4I/AAAAAAAAKGI/IKWblLFcSSo/s320/ISMmfgMarch2011.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> The dashed line is for the <a href="http://www.ism.ws/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm?navItemNumber=12942">March ISM PMI</a> of 61.2% (very strong).<br />
<br />
Clearly a reading in the low 60s (or even high 50s) shows pretty decent expansion for manufacturing.<br />
<br />
One reader told me he was surprised by the negativity. He wrote: <i>"We're finally seeing signs of real growth here. Kinda sad in a way. I was getting comfortable coming in late and still finding a parking spot close to the door."</i> Too bad - my guess he is going to have to get in a little earlier, or walk a little further!<div class="blogger-post-footer">Link to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculatedriskblog</a>!<img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10004977-1963644684151801794?l=www.calculatedriskblog.com' alt='' /></div></div>

<div>Description: Following the comments on our earlier submission to PNAS, we have written (and re-arXived) a revised version where we try to spell out (better) the distinction between ABC point (and confidence) estimation and ABC model choice, namely that the problem was at another level for Bayesian model choice (using posterior probabilities).

<div>Content:
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>F</strong>ollowing <a title="Lack of confidence is back" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/lack-of-confidence-is-back/">the comments</a> on our <a title="Lack of confidence in ABC model choice" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/24/lack-of-confidence-in-abc-model-choice/">earlier submission</a> to PNAS, we have written (and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4432v2">re-arXived</a>) a revised version where we try to spell out (better) the distinction between ABC point (and confidence) estimation and ABC model choice, namely that the problem was at another level for Bayesian model choice (using posterior probabilities). When doing point estimation with in-sufficient summary statistics, the information content is poorer, but unless one uses very degraded summary statistics, inference is converging. We completely agree with the reviewers that the posterior distribution is different from the true posterior in this case but, at least, gathering more observations brings more information about the parameter (and convergence when the number of observations goes to infinity). For model choice, this is not guaranteed if we use summary statistics that are not inter-model sufficient, as shown by the Poisson and normal examples. Furthermore, except for very specific cases such as Gibbs random fields, it is almost always impossible to derive inter-model sufficient statistics, beyond the raw sample. This is why we consider there is a fundamental difference between point estimation and model choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>F</strong>ollowing the request from a referee, we also ran a more extensive simulation experiment for comparing two scenarios with 3 populations, 100 diploid individuals per population, and 50 loci/markers. However, the results are somehow less conclusive, in the sense that, since we use 50 loci, the data is much more informative about the model and therefore both the importance sampling and the ABC approximations provide a value of the posterior probability approximation that is close to one, hence both concluding with the validation of the true model. Because both approximations are very close to one, it is difficult to assess the worth of the ABC approximation <em>per se</em>, i.e. in numerical terms. (The fact that the statistical conclusion is the same for both approaches is of course satisfying from an inferential perspective, but is an altogether separate issue from our argument about the possible lack of convergence of the ABC Bayes factor approximation to the true Bayes factor.) Furthermore, this experiment may be beyond the manageable/reasonable in the sense that the importance sampling approximation cannot be taken for granted, nor can it be checked empirically. Indeed, with 50 markers and 100 individuals, the product likelihood suffers from an enormous variability that 100,000 particles and 100 trees per locus have trouble to address (despite a huge computing cost of more than 12 days on <a href="http://migale.jouy.inra.fr/calcul">a powerful cluster</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I</strong>ncidentally, I had a problem with <a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/natbib">natbib</a>, when using the <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/misc/pnas2009.bst">pnas</a> style:</p>
<pre style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff9900;">!Package natbib Error: Bibliography not compatible with author-year citations.</span>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Press &lt;return&gt; to continue in numerical citation style.</span>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">See the natbib package documentation for explanation.</span></pre>
<p style="text-align:justify;">but it vanisheds with the options</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">which is an easy fix.</p>

From the Philly Fed: <a href="http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2011/bos0411.cfm">April 2011 Business Outlook Survey</a><br />
<blockquote>The survey’s broadest measure of manufacturing conditions, the diffusion index of current activity, <b>decreased from 43.4 in March to 18.5 this month</b>. [any reading above zero is expanion].  The demand for manufactured goods, as measured by the current new orders index, showed a similar slowing: The index fell 22 points, following seven consecutive months of increase. The shipments index declined 6 points and remained at a relatively high level. Firms continued to report that unfilled orders and delivery times were still rising.<br />
<br />
Firms’ responses continue to <b>indicate overall improvement in labor markets</b>. The current employment index fell 6 points but has remained positive for eight consecutive months. The percentage of firms reporting an increase in employment (20 percent) is higher than the percentage reporting a decline (8 percent). Over twice as many firms reported a longer workweek (32 percent) than reported a shorter one (14 percent) and the workweek index increased 5 points.</blockquote>This indicates continued expansion in April, but at a slower pace.  This was well below the consensus of 36.8.  The concern remains the pickup in both prices paid and received: <br />
<blockquote>Firms continue to report price increases for inputs as well as their own manufactured goods. The prices paid index declined 7 points this month but remains about 45 points higher than readings just seven months ago. Fifty-nine percent of the firms reported higher prices for inputs this month, compared to 64 percent last month. On balance, firms also reported an increase in prices for their own manufactured goods</blockquote><a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Manufacturing#category=Manufacturing&chart=ISMFedAprilPrelim.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1090,height=770,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="ISM PMI" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QXeqxiRO6Ug/TbA49k2fsbI/AAAAAAAAKLE/aUtelAN8YRM/s320/ISMFedAprilPrelim.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> <i><b><span style="font-size: 85%;">Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.</span></b></i><br />

Here is the weekly update on hotels from HotelNewsNow.com: <a href="http://www.hotelnewsnow.com/Articles.aspx/5391/Oahu-Island-reports-strong-weekly-results">Oahu Island reports strong weekly results</a><br />
<blockquote>Overall, the U.S. hotel industry’s occupancy was up 4.8% to 63.2%, ADR increased 3.6% to US$102.28, and RevPAR finished the week up 8.5%to US$64.67. </blockquote>Note: ADR: Average Daily Rate, RevPAR: Revenue per Available Room.<br />

This graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate.<br />
<br />
The occupancy rate is well above the levels in 2009 and 2010, but still below the occupancy rate for the same period in 2008.<br />
<br />
RevPAR and ADR are well below the peak levels prior to the recession.  So even though the occupancy rate has improved, hotel income is still much lower now than prior to the recession.<br />

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amnh.org/">American Museum of Natural History</a></strong> has two temporary exhibits that are drawing large crowds.  One, <a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/brain/">Brain: The Inside Story</a>, I can attest is worth a visit the next time you&#8217;re in NYC.  From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/20/arts/design/20museum.html">New York Times review</a>, I&#8217;d been worried that the exhibit would be full of la-de-da generalities: &#8220;how marvelously complicated is the brain!  how little we understand about it!&#8221;  But it turned out that was just the review.   The exhibit itself does a pretty good job of summarizing what&#8217;s known about how the brain is organized, how it develops, how various drugs affect it, and more.  One highlight for me was a model brain that you can take apart to see how the brain stem, limbic system, and cerebral cortex fit together&#8212;something that 2D images had never successfully conveyed to me.  The other exhibit, <a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/wld/">The World&#8217;s Largest Dinosaurs</a>, was sold out for the entire day when we tried to go there, so we had to content ourselves with the smaller dinosaurs in the rest of the museum.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.marktwainhouse.org/index.php">Mark Twain House and Museum</a></strong> in Hartford, Connecticut, should be avoided at all costs.  On a recent visit, I and my family of Twain fans were snidely turned away since we hadn&#8217;t booked a tour&#8212;a requirement buried in the website, which someone googling for the opening hours would almost certainly miss.  (This despite the fact that the museum wasn&#8217;t crowded, and we could have easily joined a tour that was starting as we arrived.)  So don&#8217;t suffer the petty bureaucrats who curate Twain&#8217;s legacy, and treat the town of Hartford the way they&#8217;d apparently like you to: as a bathroom stop along the highway from New York to Boston.  Twain would&#8217;ve been amused.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.yadvashem.org/">Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum</a></strong> in Jerusalem has been redesigned since the last time I was there, in 2002.  In the old Yad Vashem, you walked around more-or-less randomly looking at the exhibits; in the new one, you proceed in a more linear order (similar to the <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/">US Holocaust Memorial Museum</a> in Washington DC): from the rise of Nazism to the first anti-Jewish laws to the ghettoes to the gas chambers and crematoria.  The tour ends powerfully, with the Hall of Names (a large circular room with photos of victims and bookshelves of data about 3.8 million of them), followed by a balcony with a spectacular view of West Jerusalem&#8212;as if the building itself is trying to explain why the country it&#8217;s in exists.  I recommend a visit, even if you&#8217;ve been to Yad Vashem before its redesign in 2005.  But be careful to check the opening hours: the first time my family and guests tried to visit, the museum was closing, we were turned away, and we ended up going instead to a rest stop full of Elvis statues, where people lined up to use the bathroom and bought Elvis t-shirts.  (I thought that belonged in some anthology of Jewish humor.)</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> While the world&#8217;s museums have a great deal to teach us, they ought to devote more of their attention to the fundamental tasks of <strong>being open</strong> and <strong>letting people in</strong>.  People turned away from a museum are not just lost customers: they&#8217;ve often spent hours getting to an unusual place, and may be so annoyed by the wasted trip that they won&#8217;t want to return, even if they have the opportunity to do so.  In two of the cases above, I checked the website beforehand and that didn&#8217;t<em></em> suffice, since the key information I needed wasn&#8217;t there or was buried.  Yeah, I suppose I could call<em></em> ahead before every museum visit, but I hate doing that.  If someone wants to start CanIActuallyGetInToTheMuseum.com, it could be a fantastic way to not make any money.</p>

<p></p><p><em>This is a guest post by Brian Potter of  <a href="http://coarsegrained.wordpress.com/">Coarse Grained</a>. It explores a different aspect of some of the ideas in my post, <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/03/10/the-return-of-the-barbarian/">The Return of the Barbarian</a>, and Paula Hay&#8217;s guest post, <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/03/17/cognitive-archeology-of-the-west/">Cognitive Archeology of the West</a>.

<p>Consider the following experiment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task">(the Wason selection task)</a>:</p>
<p>You are shown a set of four cards placed on a table, each of which has a number on one side and a colored patch on the other side. The visible faces of the cards show 3, 8, red and brown. Which card(s) should you turn over in order to test the truth of the proposition that if a card shows an even number on one face, then its opposite face is red?</p>
<p>The correct answer is &#8220;8&#8243; and &#8220;brown&#8221;, but very few people get the correct answer &#8211; between 10-25% depending on the exact formulation of the problem. Even when its expressed in more familiar terms, such as &#8220;If a person goes to New York, then he takes the subway&#8221;, success rates remain extremely low.</p>
<p>However, consider the exact same problem, rephrased slightly:</p>
<p>You are shown a set of four cards placed on a table, each of which has a number on one side and a statement on the other side. The visible faces of the cards show 16, 25, &#8216;drinking beer&#8217; and &#8216;drinking coke&#8217;. Which card(s) should you turn over in order to test the truth of the proposition that if &#8220;If you are drinking alcohol, then you must be over 21&#8243;?</p>
<p>Phrased like this, success rates shoot up to around 75%. But what makes this form different than a question about riding the subway?</p>
<p><span id="more-2459"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Specificity of Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>The answer is that the rule above is couched in the language of a social contract, and determining whether it holds is determining whether that contract has been violated. In essence, you&#8217;re trying to figure out if anyone&#8217;s cheating. The reason we&#8217;re so much better at solving the second problem is because humans have a built in mental-module specifically for detecting cheaters. Rather than a general intelligence, what&#8217;s inside our heads is in fact a complex bundle of mechanisms each designed to solve a specific problem. And social problems are likely to have been some of the most persistent ones during our evolutionary formative years &#8211; so much so, that they may be the reason we have intelligence at all.</p>
<p>The evolution of intelligence is still somewhat of an unsolved problem. For one, it&#8217;s very difficult to create an environment that makes high intelligence worth its costs. A bigger brain means a woman is much more likely to die during childbirth, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoteny">infants must be born earlier</a> (and thus completely helpless), and that much more energy must be expended towards power-hungry neural tissue &#8211; such a trade-off is seldom worth it. For another, our intelligence emerged extremely rapidly. Over a period of a few million years human cranial capacity increased several fold, putting at at approximately seven times the size you would expect for an animal our size. That sort of jump, in the words of Dan Dennett, requires an &#8220;evolutionary crane&#8221; &#8211; something capable to doing some heavy lifting fast.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely that the social environment of our distant ancestors was such a crane, inadvertently providing a situation where the rapid emergence of intelligence was not only possible, but favorable. To understand how, consider another animal that has a body part that&#8217;s proportionally much too large &#8211; the peacock. Their huge tails serve no purpose other than decoration, and in fact make them much more likely to be consumed by predators. How could they possibly have evolved?</p>
<p>At some point in the past, probably for no good reason, peahens began have preferences for large-tailed peacocks &#8211; they began to think they were &#8220;sexy&#8221;. As a result, peacocks with large tails mated more successfully, and left more offspring. It thus became beneficial for peacocks to have large tails, even if they required more energy to grow and made them more likely to be eaten by a predator. But interestingly enough, it also became beneficial for peahens to have a preference for large tails, since having a large-tailed mate would result in large-tailed (and thus successful) children. These traits spread throughout the population, boosted by the fact that they also serve as an indication of reproductive fitness &#8211; a hugely decorated tail suggests a freedom from mutations and parasites, and that the male is fit enough to maintain it. Peacock tails gradually got larger and larger. Thus a preference which came about almost at random induced a positive feedback loop, and over time resulted in peacocks with enormous, decorative tails which serve no function. The giraffe has a similar process to thank for their enormous necks.</p>
<p>This process happens every so often in evolution &#8211; a positive feedback loop gets created, and every instance of a change creates conditions that elicit even more change. It&#8217;s known as an &#8220;arms race&#8221;, and it&#8217;s not just limited to sexual selection. The same phenomena occurs with parasite-host interactions. The parasite evolves an ability to let it infect the host, the host evolves a defense against the ability, which induces the parasite to evolve means to overcome the defense, and so on. Whenever arms races occur, they become strong drivers of evolution because they result in a constant selection pressure that the species can&#8217;t &#8220;outrun&#8221;. In fact, the phenomena is also known as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060556579/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0060556579">Red Queen hypothesis</a> after the character from <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, who must run faster and faster to simply stay in the same place.</p>
<p><strong>Social Intelligence Arms Races<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The rapid increase in brain size that occurred in hominids over the last several million years strongly suggests that the driving force behind our intelligence is some type of positive feedback loop. And the fact that most of our cognitive advancement came in the form of improved social cognition suggests that the arms race was somehow social in nature. This could have occurred in a variety of ways. One possibility is that, like the peacock&#8217;s large tail, intelligence for some reason became &#8220;sexy&#8221;. Thus there was a constant pressure on intelligence as the smartest males had the most reproductive success. However, for this to have occurred, intelligence would also have to act as some indicator of fitness &#8211; and indeed this is what we see. Intelligence correlates with body symmetry and semen quality, and may also correlate with pathogen and parasite resistance. Essentially, fitness indicators must be difficult to produce &#8211; if they&#8217;re not costly, they&#8217;ll simply be faked by cheaters who don&#8217;t possess the underlying traits. By successfully displaying a large and ornate appendage, one where a bad gene or a nutrient shortage would easily ruin it, a male is essentially saying &#8220;Not only do I have good genes, I&#8217;m so reproductively fit that I can afford to waste resources maintaining this giant thing&#8221;. As useful as big brains turned out to be, they may have evolved simply because they&#8217;re large and ornate appendages, signals of high fitness that would be difficult to fake.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that pressure to survive in larger and more complex social groups selected for larger and more complex brains that were better able to handle them. This is known as either the Social Brain hypothesis or the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis, depending on which behaviors you&#8217;re focusing on. The theory essentially states that interacting with large groups is difficult to do, and becomes MORE difficult as the members of the group get smarter. Interacting with a group involves communicating with others, understanding their intentions, forming coalitions, outwitting and deceiving others for food and mates, providing instruction &#8211; all tasks which impose a large cognitive burden. And though we don&#8217;t notice it, we&#8217;re in fact amazingly adept at social reasoning. As Wason demonstrates, consider how effortlessly we can understand complex, nested social relations (ie: &#8220;Sam wanted you to tell me about what Sue said to Ted before she talked to Steve&#8221;), and how they seem so much easier than even simple logical operations (quick, what will NOT(XOR(1 0)) output?). More intelligent individuals would outwit and out deceive their competitors and more adeptly handle the complexities of the social world, but their reproductive success would ultimately result in even sneakier opponents and an even more complex social landscape, resulting in a continuous pressure on improving intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>The Russian Fox</strong></p>
<p>But my personal favorite (though not necessarily the most likely to be accurate) is what I&#8217;ve dubbed the Russian Fox hypothesis. Over a period of 45 years, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox">a group of foxes in a lab in Russia</a> were continuously bred, with one small stipulation &#8211; only the friendliest, least aggressive, most docile foxes out of each generation were allowed to breed. Over many generations, this resulted in a group of tame foxes &#8211; foxes which were eager to associate with humans, wagged their tails when happy or excited, had floppy ears, and overall exhibited many dog-like traits. Experiments showed, that, even though only tameness was selected for, these foxes showed an increased ability to follow and understand human gestures &#8211; in essence, they showed increased social intelligence. It&#8217;s possible that the evolution of human intelligence was a response to a similar pressure &#8211; that in fact we were being selected for increased docility, and increased intelligence was a mere &#8220;correlated byproduct&#8221; &#8211; an accident.</p>
<p>This selection for docility would help to explain another puzzle of human behavior &#8211; our sense of cooperation and altruism. Human society, no matter how primitive, is based on a large-scale division of labor. We show unprecedented cooperation on food sharing, hunting, and warfare &#8211; even those not directly related to us, and even when it costs us a great deal to do so. This goes far beyond the cooperation of any other animal and far beyond what a simple &#8220;gene selection&#8221; model would predict. However, Herbert Simon showed how docility, by making an individual more disposed to accepting instruction, could allow for the emergence of truly altruistic behaviors by simply bundling them with other &#8220;taught&#8221; behaviors. If human society was sufficiently strict about enforcing its norms (which would include the rules for social interaction), this would create a pressure for better ability to learn them, and result in the appearance of specialized social skills.</p>
<p>By asking which (if any) of these hypotheses is correct, we&#8217;re doing more than determining how intelligence evolved &#8211; we&#8217;re in fact asking about the sort of society that our ancestors lived in. The Social Brain hypothesis seems to imply a competitive society where men are pitted against each other for access to females, where each person strives to understand the nuances of the social world in order to further their own best interests, and where everyone is trying to game everyone else. A society of competition and deception, but also one of freedom.</p>
<p>Russian Fox, on the other hand, implies a society where proper behaviors are strictly enforced, where altruism is expected and rewarded, and where people do won&#8217;t go along pay stiff penalties. A cooperative, yet restrictive society, where altruism exists but is enforced.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual Selection as a Wildcard</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060556579/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0060556579">Sexual selection</a> was probably a driver in each of these theories, but it could have played a role in many different ways. If the primary driver was competition between males for females, that would primarily select for the ability to outwit and out-think, and place it in line with the social brain. But if the primary driver was female choice, it&#8217;s more likely that altruism would be selected for &#8211; altruistic mates would be more likely to be good fathers.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not as if we&#8217;re forced to settle on one of these. In fact, it&#8217;s often fairly difficult to determine where the dividing lines are between the theories. An important part of Social Brain is the ability to woo mates, which implies elements of female preference and sexual selection. And if altruistic behavior (arising from docility) were an important part of society, female sexual selection could have been an important part of it&#8217;s enforcement. And being able to cooperate requires, on some level, an ability to understand the intentions of others, so baring some sort of cosmic experiment it&#8217;s unlikely that whatever pressure existed was on tameness alone. The hypotheses are all bundled together in one complex heap. We shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see elements of all of them exerting force on the evolution of our intelligence.</p>
<p>And if these pressures all existed simultaneously, it would be reflected in ancient society. We&#8217;d expect to see humans both cooperating and competing with one another, acting altruistically one moment and stabbing someone in the back the next. And though our vision of past society only extends back a few thousand years, this certainly matches with what we can plumb from history. Social dynamics, then, has gone unchanged not only for the thousands of years of recorded history &#8211; but for millions of years prior to that. We&#8217;ve come a long way, but maybe not quite as far as we think we have. In some sense, the path of human advancement is finding new ways to do the same old things.</p>

It gets most of its information from a rich and wide stream of sources (conversations on e-mails, twitter, webpages featuring papers, courses, jobs). It is also the <b>1000th</b> entry on compressive sensing on Nuit Blanche. This week-end, the number of people reading this blog through an RSS Feed crossed the 1100 threshold while the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=683737&amp;goback=%2Egsm_683737_1_*2_*2_*2_lna_PENDING_*2">LinkedIn Compressive Sensing Group</a> now gathers 830 members. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Following up on the recent entries about the <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2011/04/cs-compressible-realization-of-gaussian.html">"compressibility" of the realizations of the Gaussian noise</a> (see also <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2011/04/cs-follow-up-on-compressible.html">here</a>), <a href="http://cmrr-star.ucsd.edu/oshental/">Ori Shental</a>&nbsp;who started me into writing about this with <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1104/1104.2215v1.pdf">his paper</a>, sent me the following:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">Dear Igor,&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">Following your recent post about the WGN simulation:</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Please note that according to Claim #3, stating the marginal achieving distribution (and its illustration in Fig. 2), the SPARSEST representation of WGN (i.e., on the threshold curve itself) consists of *infinite* spikes (namely uniform distribution in the +/- infinity) for the non-zero entries. According to the derived marginal distribution of the non-zero entries of the sparse WGN representation there is a *gap*, or a dead-zone, in the values taken by those non-zero entries, which increases to infinite as you get closer to the threshold curve (please look at the example Gaussian tails on Figure 2).</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Hence in the limit of large systems, the sparsest representation is composed of infinite values, a picture which is difficult to reproduce in practical simulation. However Claim 3, gives us a hint on how to threshold the simulation results in order to grasp the entire "compressibility" (i.e. get the full "belly" beyond the trivial \alpha=\kappa line): According to eq. (23) any non-zero value *below* (in absolute value) the standard deviation (multiplied by some auxiliary scalar \xi) of the Gaussian, described also in eq. (23), should be discarded and set to 0. This STD can be inferred from the histogram of the results obtained by SL0, IRLS or any other approximation to L0. This thresholding should allow us to imitate the workings in the limit of large systems, based on finite-size simulation data.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cheers,</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Ori</div></blockquote><br />

</div><div style="text-align: justify;">PS. I am collaborating with Prof. Mark Richards from Georgia Tech to post some of my rail SAR phase data on the web so that students can use it.  Mark tells me it is tough to get raw data, or pretty much impossible without lots of restrictions.  So i figured it would be good to let the compressed sensing community know this when it happens because you guys might want to play around with actual radar phase data.  Hope this helps.</div></blockquote>Thanks&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~gr20603/Dr.%20Gregory%20L.%20Charvat%20Projects/Home.html">Greg</a>&nbsp;!<br />

The abstract reads:</div></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">The Compressive Sensing (CS) framework aims to ease the burden on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) by reducing the sampling rate required to acquire and stably recover sparse&nbsp;signals. Practical ADCs not only sample but also quantize each measurement to a finite number&nbsp;of bits; moreover, there is an inverse relationship between the achievable sampling rate and the&nbsp;bit depth. In this paper, we investigate an alternative CS approach that shifts the emphasis&nbsp;from the sampling rate to the number of bits per measurement. In particular, we explore the&nbsp;extreme case of 1-bit CS measurements, which capture just their sign. Our results come in two flavors. First, we consider ideal reconstruction from noiseless 1-bit measurements and provide&nbsp;a lower bound on the best achievable reconstruction error. We also demonstrate that a large&nbsp;class of measurement mappings achieve this optimal bound. Second, we consider reconstruction robustness to measurement errors and noise and introduce the Binary  -Stable Embedding (B SE) property, which characterizes the robustness measurement process to sign changes. We show the same class of matrices that provide optimal noiseless performance also enable such a robust mapping. On the practical side, we introduce the Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm for signal reconstruction from 1-bit measurements that offers state-of-the-art performance.</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">From an e-mail conversation I had with&nbsp;<a href="http://perso.uclouvain.be/laurent.jacques/index.php/Main/HomePage">Laurent</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ece.rice.edu/~jnl5066/home.html">Jason</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://web.ece.rice.edu/richb/">Rich</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~peyre/">Gabriel Peyre</a>, it looks like a demo will shortly be available on the interwebs. thanks guys, I know somebody who's looking at the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/08/hummingearth/">Earth Hum</a> who wants to test this thing.</div><br />

The abstract reads:</div><blockquote style="text-align: justify;">In sensor networks and communication systems, one is often confronted with sampling multiple sparse&nbsp;signals having a common support set. Multipath channels in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)&nbsp;wireless communication setting is an interesting example where one generally needs to perform channel&nbsp;estimation for each transmit-receive antenna pair. MIMO multipath channels are usually (approximately)&nbsp;sparse and satisfy the common-support property whenever the distances between the antennas are small&nbsp;compared to the distance the electromagnetic wave can travel in the time corresponding to the inverse&nbsp;bandwidth of the communication system. This assumption is satisﬁed by small and medium bandwidth&nbsp;communication systems like OFDM and CDMA.&nbsp;This leads us to extend the ﬁnite rate of innovation sampling and reconstruction scheme to the sparse&nbsp;common-support scenario (SCS-FRI), in which input signals contain Diracs with common locations but&nbsp;arbitrary weights. The goal is to efﬁciently reconstruct the input signals from a set of uniform samples,&nbsp;making use of the common-support property to improve robustness. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the best theoretical&nbsp;performance for the SCS-FRI setup by deriving the Cram´er-Rao lower bound. Our results show that for a&nbsp;set of well-separated Diracs, it is the total energy of the Diracs at each common position which determines&nbsp;the bound. We then propose a multi-channel reconstruction algorithm and compare its performance with&nbsp;the Cram´er-Rao lower bound. Numerical results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed&nbsp;sampling and reconstruction scheme in low SNR regimes</blockquote><br />

<blockquote>Spectral factorization is a classical tool in signal processing and communications. It also plays a critical role in X-ray crystallography, in&nbsp;the context of phase retrieval. In this work, we study the problem&nbsp;of sparse spectral factorization, aiming to recover a one-dimensional&nbsp;sparse signal from its autocorrelation. We present a sufﬁcient condition for the recovery to be unique, and propose an iterative algorithm&nbsp;that can obtain the original signal (up to a sign change, time-shift and&nbsp;time-reversal). Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the&nbsp;proposed algorithm.</blockquote><br />

<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">We propose an algorithm (SCS-FRI) to estimate multipath channels&nbsp;with Sparse Common Support (SCS) based on Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) sampling. In this setup, theoretical lower-bounds are&nbsp;derived, and simulation in a Rayleigh fading environment shows that&nbsp;SCS-FRI gets very close to these bounds. We show how to apply&nbsp;SCS-FRI to OFDM and CDMA downlinks. Recovery of a sparse&nbsp;common support is, among other, especially relevant for channel estimation in a multiple output system or beam-forming from multiple&nbsp;input. The present algorithm is based on a multi-output extension of&nbsp;the Cadzow denoising/annihilating ﬁlter method [1, 2].</blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />

<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">The present paper proposes and studies an algorithm to estimate channels with a sparse common support (SCS). It is a generalization of&nbsp;the classical sampling of signals with Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI)&nbsp;[1] and thus called SCS-FRI. It is applicable to OFDM and WalshHadamard coded (CDMA downlink) communications since SCS-FRI&nbsp;is shown to work not only on contiguous DFT pilots but also uniformly&nbsp;scattered ones. The support estimation performances compare favorably&nbsp;to theoretical lower-bounds, and importantly this translates into a substantial equalization gain at the receiver compared to the widely used&nbsp;spectrum lowpass interpolation method.</blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />

The abstract reads:<br />
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">Image frames from dynamic MRI can be abstracted&nbsp;as the superposition of the background component, which is&nbsp;temporally coherent, and the motion component, which is spatially&nbsp;sparse, up to the proper basis. Inspired by their distinct&nbsp;characterizations, we introduce the divide-and-conquer&nbsp;spatiotemporal matrix decomposition approach, namely Prior&nbsp;Rank, Intensity and Sparsity Model (PRISM). Here the temporal&nbsp;coherence of the background component is enforced by the rank&nbsp;regularization and the spatial sparsity of the motion component is&nbsp;promoted by the sparsity regularization in framelets. The&nbsp;validation with both synthetic and experimental cardiac data and&nbsp;the comparison with the state-of-art reconstruction methods show&nbsp;that PRISM is feasible for maintaining the reconstruction quality&nbsp;with much fewer samples. The consequent reduction of data&nbsp;acquisition time can relax the breath-holding constraint with&nbsp;possibly less respiratory motion artifact and more  regular heart&nbsp;rate in cardiac cine imaging, and enable the imaging of patients&nbsp;with faster heart rate in real-time cardiac cine imaging.</blockquote><br />

Extracting the rules from all these different policy sources, mapping them to executable business rules in a BRMS&#8217;s repository and ensuring traceability between them (perhaps through an intermediate level of rules) is essential. This allows Decision Services to be deployed that apply the right rules for particular transactions and particular decisions. It also allows an accurate assessment of  which rules must be changed when policies or the regulations on which they are based change. In many ways it is this ability to <strong>manage</strong> rules that drives the need for a BRMS rather than its ability to execute them.</p>
<p>Enterprise risk management, good GRC practices, require that every decision you make accounts for its contribution to overall risk. Make sure you are managing these operational decisions, that you are managing the rules behind them and that you are maximizing the use of predictive analytics too.</p>

The most followed house price indexes are Case-Shiller and CoreLogic - and also the FHFA index based on repeat sales of homes with loans sold to or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.<br />
<br />
The FHFA reported this morning: <a href="http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/21156/HPI42111.pdf">U.S. Monthly House Price Index Declined 1.6 Percent from January to February</a><br />
<blockquote>U.S. house prices declined 1.6 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis from January to February, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s monthly House Price Index. The previously reported 0.3 percent decrease in January was revised to a 1.0 percent decrease. For the 12 months ending in February, U.S. prices fell 5.7 percent. The U.S. index is 18.6 percent below its April 2007 peak and roughly the same as the February 2004 index level.</blockquote>There are several other house price indexes that I follow: <a href="http://www.radarlogic.com/">RadarLogic</a> (based on a house price per square foot method, to be released this afternoon for February), <a href="http://www.fncresidentialpriceindex.com/tables.aspx">FNC Residential Price Index</a> (a hedonic price index), <a href="http://www.clearcapital.com/company/market.cfm">Clear Capital</a> and more.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on mentioning these other indexes, in addition to Case-Shiller and CoreLogic, and discussing some of the differences.<br />
<br />
From FNC this morning: <a href="http://www.fncresidentialpriceindex.com/press_releases.aspx?pr=26">February Single-Family Home Prices Decline 0.7 Percent</a> <br />
<blockquote>FNC announced Thursday that U.S. home prices weakened only slightly in February—a better-than-expected price seasonality.<br />
<br />
Based on the latest data on non-distressed home sales (existing and new homes), FNC’s Residential Price Index™ (RPI) indicated that home prices in February declined 0.7% from January, or 5.3% from a year ago. <br />
<br />
Contrary to expectations of relatively rapid price deteriorations, February delivered instead the slowest one-month price declines since November. Even so, the trend shows that weak housing demand and spillovers from rising distressed sales continue to affect the mortgage market.<br />
<br />
FNC’s RPI – the industry’s first hedonic price index built on a comprehensive database blending public records with real-time appraisals – also showed home prices nationwide are currently 1.9% below the end of 2010 and comparable to May 2003 on a cyclical basis.</blockquote>According to FNC, house prices are at a post-bubble low, and are back to May 2003 prices. You can see the FNC composite index, and prices for 30 cities <a href="http://www.fncresidentialpriceindex.com/tables.aspx">here</a>.<br />

Copyright © 2011 http://jtonedm.com James Taylor<br><br /><p><a href="http://www.g-stat.com/">G-Stat</a> is a privately held Israeli company focused on advanced analytical and data mining solutions. The founder of G-Stat began his career as an econometrician, focusing on large time-series data initially. Then he worked at the Bank of Israel in IT helping translate what the economists and others needed into information systems. He rapidly became interested in data mining and founded a professional services company that supports customer analytics for large companies in Israel. This business focused on using SAS analytics tools initially and Unica more recently. The services business is now over 160 people focused on 1:1 or precision marketing (churn prediction, upsell/cross-sell) and credit risk. The credit risk practice is increasingly in the context of Basel II and this has moved them from doing just the analytic modeling to delivering complete credit risk solutions.</p>
<p>In this professional services work G Stat found that the time to implement data mining and predictive analytic models was too high. Because the barrier to getting models implemented was too high, many clients failed to get these models into production and this led to the development of the G-Soft Xeligence platform. Each Xeligence solution contains a data schema, out of the box processes for data management and data mining, packaged models and rules, a user interface for non-technical users and reporting/dashboards.</p>
<p>Their most mature product is Xeligence NBO – Next Best Offer – that sits between the data warehouse and the CRM or Campaign Management system. Xeligence is designed to produce models in an automated process – taking in data, running analyses, building models and deploying them into the campaign environment. One customer for example had 5 models that were re-calibrated every few years before working with G-Stat. Now they have 70-80 models re-developed and deployed each month with just a couple of work days to supervise and direct. These models are used in Unica to drive 1:1 marketing decisions. They have about 10-12 customers using this product and feeding the results into their campaign management environments and have a global agreement with IBM and various other global as well as regional partners  to supply this model creation and tuning environment alongside Unica and other campaign management tools.</p>
<p>Based on their success in Israel they are expanding – mostly into Europe but increasingly also into US. They have a newer product focused on churn predictions (in use with 2 customers) and have just finished a segmentation and LTV calculation and credit scoring engines.</p>
<p>All the Xeligence products implement the whole process of building, tuning and deploying models in very specific domains. They combine business domain experience with an understanding of how to build and deploy models and business process management to automate the analytical processes in an organization. This combination of business domain expertise with the automation of the analytic processes allows a business team to effectively manage the analytic process.</p>
<p>As they expand into credit risk obviously this complete automation becomes more complex as these credit risk decisions are regulated. For this they have developed an “analytical ETL tool” targeted to risk managers in retail banks. This product loads data into an in-memory column store so users can do all the transformations necessary for credit risk modeling. This exposes the rate of change transformations for instance, critical to credit risk modeling, as simple functions that can be easily used to build models. This eliminates the flattening and transformation of data common to manual data mining processes. The process of reviewing and creating models is thus shortened. The credit risk platform has integrated deployment also, eliminating the time and cost of deployment. Finally the models are also documented as they are created.</p>

<div>Content:
I recently read and reviewed
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pea-Sun-Mathematical-Paradox/dp/1568812132">The Pea and
The Sun</a> by Leonard Wapner,  which is about the Banach-Tarski Paradox.
Recall that the Banach-Tarski Paradox is actually a theorem (not a paradox)
that says you can take apart a ball of volume 1 into a finite number of pieces (some of the pieces
will be VERY funky) and reassemble to get a ball of volume 2.
By repeating this process you can take a pea and get a ball the size of the sun.
(My review is <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pea.pdf">here</a>).

<br>
<br>
When I told my wife this theorem (she has a Masters in Comp Sci and knows some math)
she said <i>Math is Broken!!!</i>. She later wondered why mathematicians
didn't just toss out The Axiom of Choice (for uncountable sets)
since it leads to such an obviously false theorem.

<br>
<br>
By coincidence, Leonard Wapner had just emailed me to thank me for my review (and to agree that
<i>MacArthur Park</i> is the worst song ever written, see
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/HUMOR/worstsongs.html">this article</a>
on my website).
SO I put the question to him- why didn't mathematicians just toss out AC
since it leads to BT?
What follows is an edited version of our back and fourth emails.

<br>
<br>

BILL: I told my wife the Banach-Tarski Paradox
and she wonders why mathematicians didn't just IMMEDIATELY toss out
the Axiom of choice for uncountable sets since BT is so obviously false.

<br>
<br>

LEONARD: I do not believe BT is obviously false.  I believe it to be true, based
on the axioms of set theory, including AC.
Your wife is claiming there are no <i>real world</i> manifestations of the
phenomenon.  She is not alone with this feeling.  Personally, I am
highly skeptical of there being any real world models of the BT result.
(Those given in the book were clearly labeled as speculations at best.

<br>
<br>

But, I also believe we can't rule out the possibility, based on
mathematical and physical discoveries, to date.  BT does not contradict
any theorem or axiom.  And, it's no more counterintuitive than some Baby
BTs (mini version of BT that proceeded it that are also counter-intuitive)
and some physical phenomena (relativity, quantum mechanics, etc.)

<br>
<br>

BILL: By the time BT was proven AC was embedded into the
math culture. Many things had already been build on it.
Is that why Math folks didn't just toss it out?
Would anything important be lost if we tossed uncountable AC out?

<br>
<br>

LEONARD: I believe it wasn't tossed out because there was no mathematical
justification (in the way of a mathematical contradiction) to do so.  If
AC were to produce a mathematical contradiction, then, being a
questionable axiom, it might be tossed.  But, there is no mathematical
contradiction and I think most mathematicians accept AC.  In any case,
it would be even more counterintuitive for some to drop it than accept
the BT result.  AC allows for surprises, but no mathematical contradictions.

<br>
<br>

I suspect that there
are useful theorems, relying on AC, which would be lost if AC were to be
tossed.  I can't give a specific example now, but I do know that there
have been proofs relying on AC which have encouraged others to prove
those same theorems without AC.  BT, in its usual form, requires AC.
Some variations of it do not.

<br>
<br>

BILL: BT is obv false in the real world. Is this enough of a reason to toss
it out (my wife things so).

<br>
<br>

LEONARD: Coincidentally, my wife asks me the exact same question.  And, this is
precisely what intrigues me about BT and other paradoxes.  As I write
above, I prefer to say it is "apparently" false in the real world,
rather than obviously false.  I can't rule out that which I've not seen
simply because I've not seen it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3722233-2459498477941171074?l=blog.computationalcomplexity.org' alt='' /></div></div>

<p><font color="#808080">Got questions about <i>Mathematica</i>? The Wolfram Blog has answers! We&#8217;ll regularly answer selected questions from users around the web. You can <a href= "http://blog.wolfram.com/ask-a-question/">submit your question directly to the Q&#038;A Team using this form</a>.</font></p>
<p>This week&#8217;s question comes from Patrick, a student:</p>
<p><i><b>How can I use <tt>Sow</tt> &#038; <tt>Reap</tt> across parallel kernels?</i></b></p>
<p>Before we answer this question, a review of the useful functions <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Sow.html">Sow</a></tt> and <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Reap.html">Reap</a></tt> is in order.</p>
<p><tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Sow.html">Sow</a></tt> and <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Reap.html">Reap</a></tt> are used together to build up a list of results during a computation. <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Sow.html">Sow</a></tt>[<i>expr</i>] puts <i>expr</i> aside to be collected later. <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Reap.html">Reap</a></tt> collects these and returns a list:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/04/ReapSow1-+-Sow2-x-Sow3.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Reap[Sow[1] + Sow[2] x Sow[3]]" title="Reap[Sow[1] + Sow[2] x Sow[3]]" width="244" height="31" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5584" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/04/7-123.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="{7, {{1,2,3}}}" title="{7, {{1,2,3}}}" width="155" height="20" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5587" /></p>
<p>The first part of the list is the regular result of the computation. The second part is everything that was &ldquo;sown&rdquo;.</p>
<p><tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Sow.html">Sow</a></tt> and <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Reap.html">Reap</a></tt> are ideally suited to situations in which you don&#8217;t know in advance how many results you will get. For example, suppose that you want to find simple initial conditions that lead to &#8220;interesting&#8221; results in <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Life.html">Conway&#8217;s game of life</a>, the famous two-dimensional cellular automaton:<br />
<span id="more-5563"></span></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/04/Two-dimensional-cellular-automaton.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Two-dimensional cellular automaton" title="Two-dimensional cellular automaton" width="489" height="79" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5588" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll call a result &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; if it has at least <i>n</i> cells alive (live cells have value 1):</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/04/Define-interesting.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Define interesting" title="Define interesting" width="442" height="33" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5589" /></p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ll check 1,000 random 6X6 initial conditions for the &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; property of having at least 200 live cells after 100 steps. Whenever the result is <tt>InterestingQ</tt>, we create and <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Sow.html">Sow</a></tt> a simple visualization:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/04/Check-1000-random-conditions.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Check 1000 random conditions" title="Check 1000 random conditions" width="483" height="134" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5591" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/04/Sow-a-simple-visualization.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Sow a simple visualization" title="Sow a simple visualization" width="235" height="91" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5590" /></p>
<p>One interesting result was found and sown. If we want to conduct a larger search, we ought to take advantage of <i><a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</i></a>&#8217;s automatic parallelization.</p>
<p>This brings us to our main question: What&#8217;s the right way to <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Sow.html">Sow</a></tt> results in the parallel subkernels, but <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Reap.html">Reap</a></tt> them in the master kernel?</p>
<p>In this case the answer is particularly simple: define a version of <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Sow.html">Sow</a></tt> that always runs on the master kernel.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/04/Define-a-version-of-Sow.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Define a version of Sow" title="Define a version of Sow" width="265" height="50" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5592" /></p>
<p><tt><a href= "http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/SetSharedFunction.html">SetSharedFunction</a></tt> specifies that a function should always run on the master kernel.</p>
<p>Now we can apply <tt><a href= "http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Parallelize.html">Parallelize</a></tt> to our search. Here&#8217;s a search of 10,000 random initial conditions:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/04/Parallelize.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Parallelize" title="Parallelize" width="412" height="187" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5593" /></p>
<p><img src="http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2011/04/Parallelize-visualizations.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" alt="Parallelize visualizations" title="Parallelize visualizations" width="500" height="399" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5594" /></p>
<p>Note that <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Reap.html">Reap</a></tt> and <tt><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Sow.html">Sow</a></tt> remain unaffected, and you can use them just as usual in algorithms running on parallel subkernels. Only our new function <tt>ParallelSow</tt> runs on the master kernel.</p>

        <p>Galin Jones, Steve Brooks, Xiao-Li Meng and I edited a handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo that has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Chapman-Handbooks-Statistical-Methods/dp/1420079417/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1302790043&sr=8-1">just been published</a>.  My chapter (with Kenny Shirley) is <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/GelmanMCMCchapter4.pdf">here</a>, and it begins like this:</p>

<blockquote>Convergence of Markov chain simulations can be monitored by measuring the diffusion and mixing of multiple independently-simulated chains, but different levels of convergence are appropriate for different goals. When considering inference from stochastic simulation, we need to separate two tasks: (1) inference about parameters and functions of parameters based on broad characteristics of their distribution, and (2) more precise computation of expectations and other functions of probability distributions. For the first task, there is a natural limit to precision beyond which additional simulations add essentially nothing; for the second task, the appropriate precision must be decided from external considerations. We illustrate with an example from our current research, a hierarchical model of trends in opinions on the death penalty in U.S. states.</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working for some time on implementing a <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/lle/algorithm.html">locally linear embedding</a> algorithm for the upcoming manifold module in scikit-learn. </p>
<p>While several implementations of this algorithm exist in Python, as far as I know none of them is able to use a sparse eigensolver in the last step of the algorithm, falling back to dense routines causing a huge overhead in this step. </p>
<p>To overcome this, my first implementation used <code>scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh</code>, which is a sparse eigensolver shipped by scipy and based on ARPACK. However, this approach converged extremely slowly, with timings that exceeded largely those of dense solvers.</p>
<p>Recently I found a way that seems to work reasonably well, with timings that win by a factor of 5 on the swiss roll existing routines. This code is able to solve the problem making use of a preconditioner computed by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyamg/">PyAMG</a>.</p>

<div>Description: A computer implemented method is provided to expand a limited amount of input to conditional probability data filling a Bayesian Belief network based decision support apparatus. The conditional probability data defines conditional probabilities of states of a particular network node as a function of vectors of state values of a set of parent nodes of the particular network node in the Bayesian Belief network. The computer implemented method comprises receiving elicited conditional probability data that defines the conditional probabilities of the state values of the particular network node for a subset of all possible vectors of combinations of state values of the parent nodes. Conditional probability data defining the conditional probabilities of the state values of the particular network node for further possible vectors of state values of the parent nodes is interpolated from the elicited conditional probability data. The influence factors are determined.</div>

<div>Description: Disclosed herein are systems, computer-implemented methods, and computer-readable storage media for tagging a known signal of interest. Initially, the system classifies the data from an input signal using a short-term classifier, wherein there are at least two classifications available, a first classification of the data as having no identified outputs and a second classification of the data as at least one potential signal of interest, wherein the short-term classifier also bypasses data that is known to be of no interest. After the short-term classifier classifies the inputs, it collapses the input data that is classified as having no identified outputs. This allows the short-term classifier to create time-variant data. Finally, the system will tag a known signal of interest in the time-variant data that was classified as having at least one potential signal of interest. Therefore, a system for tagging a known signal of interest is described.</div>

<div>Description: Clock gating circuit is determined by transforming a clock gating opportunity function to a non-Boolean function and constraining inputs of the non-Boolean function. The non-Boolean function may be a ternary function. Constraining the inputs may be achieved by introducing control variables and a cardinality constraint associated with their values. The non-Boolean function may be utilized to approximate universal quantification of an input assigned with a non-Boolean value, such as “don't care” value. The non-Boolean function may be utilized to provide an ALL SAT solution of a Boolean function using a SAT solver.</div>

<div>Description: Intelligent Trust Management provides a centralized security facility that gives system components a flexible mechanism for implementing security policies. System components such as applications create a request describing an action that needs to be checked against an appropriate security policy. The request is given to a trust system that determines which policy object applies to the request, and may pass request arguments to the policy. The policy objects include executable code that uses any arguments along with dynamically obtained variable information to make a decision. The decision is returned to the system component, which then operates accordingly. Policy objects may maintain state and interface with the user independent of the system component in order to obtain information to make their decisions. Policy objects may call other policy objects and/or mathematically combine the results of other policy objects to make a decision.</div>

<div>Description: A conflict resolution mechanism collects statistical data regarding how much time certain common actions or waits take. For example, the mechanism may collect statistics on disk I/O for each disk device. Statistics may include the average access time, for example. Such statistics may be collected over a sliding window of time. With the statistical data that the mechanism collects, the mechanism can make a more intelligent judgment regarding whether a process is in a “hanging” condition. For example, if the average I/O to a disk is 10 seconds for the past hour, and if a process is doing disk I/O to that disk for 5 seconds, then the mechanism will not yet determine that the process is hanging. In order to determine whether the process is hanging, the mechanism looks at the average time and the longest time for the particular actions that the process is performing.</div>

The <a href="http://explore.trulia.com/datavis/priceredux/Q1-2011/">Trulia Price Reductions Map</a> can help with that. It shows the average number of days until house prices tend to drop for the first. </p>
<p>Yellow areas on average stay the same price for 120 days or more. Blue areas change after about 30 days. You can also view average percent reduction and the probability of a second reduction.</p>

<p>The maps are speckled, but zoom in on major areas, and they look more like maps of where people want to live. This makes sense since houses will usually sell quicker in areas where people want to live. If a house isn't purchased right away, then it's probably priced too high. Conversely, areas where there aren't many potential buyers to begin with will wait longer before reducing housing prices.</p>

<p>When I talked with SAS about <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2011/04/21/sas-hpa-does-make-sense-after-all/">its forthcoming in-memory parallel SAS HPA offering</a>, we talked briefly about application areas. The three SAS cited were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer financial services.</strong> The idea here is to combine information about customers&#8217; use of all kinds of services &#8212; banking, credit cards, loans, etc. SAS believes this is both for marketing and risk analysis purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance.</strong> We didn&#8217;t go into detail.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile communications.</strong> SAS&#8217; customers aren&#8217;t giving it details, but they&#8217;re excited about geocoding/geospatial data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, in another interview I heard about, SAS emphasized <strong>retailers.</strong> Indeed, that&#8217;s what spawned my recent post about <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2011/04/06/so-can-logistic-regression-be-parallelized-or-not/">logistic regression</a>.</p>
<p>The mobile communications one is a bit scary. Your cell phone &#8212; and hence your cellular company &#8212; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker/">know where you are</a>, pretty much from moment to moment. Even without advanced analytic technology applied to it, that&#8217;s a pretty direct privacy threat. Throw in some analytics, and your cell company might know, for example, who you hang out with (in person), where you shop, and how those things predict your future behavior. And so the government &#8212; or just your employer &#8212; might know those</p>

<p>I talked with SAS about its <a rel="nofollow">new approach to parallel modeling</a>. The two key points are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SAS no longer plans to go as far with in-database modeling as it previously intended.</strong></li>
<li>Rather, <strong>SAS plans to run in RAM on MPP DBMS appliances,</strong> exploiting MPI (Message Passing Interface).</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole thing is called SAS HPA (High-Performance Analytics), in an obvious reference to HPC (High-Performance Computing). It will run initially on RAM-heavy appliances from Teradata and EMC Greenplum.</p>
<p>A lot of what&#8217;s going on here is that SAS found it annoyingly difficult to parallelize modeling within the framework of a massively parallel DBMS such as Teradata. Notes on that aspect include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SAS wasn&#8217;t exploiting the capabilities of individual DBMS to their fullest;</strong> rather, it was looking for an approach that would work across multiple brands of DBMS. Thus, for example, the fact that Aster&#8217;s analytic platform architecture is more flexible or powerful than Teradata&#8217;s didn&#8217;t help much with making SAS run within the Aster nCluster database.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding everything else, <strong>SAS did make a certain set of modeling procedures run in-database.</strong></li>
<li><strong>SAS&#8217; previous plans to run in-database modeling in Aster and/or Netezza DBMS may never come to fruition.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-4343"></span>SAS&#8217; problems developing in-database modeling stem from, in essence, the limitations of UDFs (User Defined Functions). So why weren&#8217;t, for example, <a rel="nofollow">Teradata&#8217;s 2009 enhancements to its UDF capabilities</a> enough? The clearest example SAS gave me is that, while <a rel="nofollow">database tables are commonly limited to something on the order of 1000 columns</a> (their figure as well as mine), SAS might need 50-100,000 columns. One reason seems to be interactions between variables; SAS used the word &#8220;multiplied&#8221; a few times, but even so was coy about whether this could simply be regarded as quadratic terms in a regression. Another reason seems to be that in some cases, every value in a column spawns a new column in an intermediate table/array; indeed, this seems to be going on in the previously discussed case of <a rel="nofollow">logistic regression</a>.</p>
<p>SAS code will be launched by the DBMS/data warehouse appliances, so potentially it can run under their native workload management. Teradata presumably has enough workload management richness to exploit that; EMC Greenplum, as of my August 2010 notes, probably did not.</p>
<p>SAS was gracious enough to let me post its slide deck, in both <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.monash.com/uploads/SAS_HPA_2011-Shorter.pdf">shorter</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.monash.com/uploads/SAS_HPA_2011-Longer.pdf">longer</a> versions. Due to a technical glitch during the call, I neither looked at the slides nor took notes. I think the biggest loss from those difficulties is that I didn&#8217;t learn what the futures at the end of the longer deck were all about.</p>

This time around, they look at <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/10-charts-about-sex/">sex and how ideas vary by demographic</a>.  The above graph shows per capita GDP versus portion of people looking for casual sex.</p>
<blockquote><p>We were amazed at this result&mdash;money seems to be a more powerful influence on sex drive than culture or even religion.</p>
<p>You have, for example, Portugal, Oman, Slovenia, and Taiwan within a few pixels of each other on the right side of the graph, and Syria, Sri Lanka, and Guatemala almost stacked on the left, and all of them sit along the trend line.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting as usual. What amazes me more is that so many people answer such private questions. Have any of you tried OkCupid? Are these questions part of the matching process?</p>
<p>See OkCupid for more findings on sex such as drive and body type and Twitter usage and commitment.</p>

The abstract reads:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">The literature on compressed sensing has focused almost entirely on settings where the signal is noiseless and the measurements are contaminated by noise. In practice, however, the signal itself is often subject to random noise prior to measurement. We briefly study this setting and show that, for the vast majority of measurement schemes employed in compressed sensing, the two models are equivalent with the important difference that the signal-to-noise ratio is divided by a factor proportional to p/n, where p is the dimension of the signal and n is the number of observations. Since p/n is often large, this leads to noise folding which can have a severe impact on the SNR.</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://tulane.edu/sse/bme/faculty/wang.cfm">Yu-Ping. Wang</a>&nbsp;just submitted his recent work on ArXiv:&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1104/1104.3792v1.pdf">A sufficient condition on monotonic increase of the number of nonzero entry in the optimizer of L1 norm penalized least-square problem</a> by Junbo Duan, <a href="http://archives.limsi.fr/Individu/soussen/">Charles Soussen</a>, <a href="http://www.cran.uhp-nancy.fr/cran_serv/detailindividu?appel=themes_rech&amp;codetheme=03&amp;codelangue=FR&amp;codeindividu=brie">David Brie</a>, <a href="http://www.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/~idier/">Jerome Idier</a>, <a href="http://tulane.edu/sse/bme/faculty/wang.cfm">Yu-Ping. Wang</a>. The abstract reads:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">The $\ell$-1 norm based optimization is widely used in signal processing, especially in recent compressed sensing theory. This paper studies the solution path of the $\ell$-1 norm penalized least-square problem, whose constrained form is known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). A solution path is the set of all the optimizers with respect to the evolution of the hyperparameter (Lagrange multiplier). The study of the solution path is of great significance in viewing and understanding the profile of the tradeoff between the approximation and regularization terms. If the solution path of a given problem is known, it can help us to find the optimal hyperparameter under a given criterion such as the Akaike Information Criterion. In this paper we present a sufficient condition on $\ell$-1 norm penalized least-square problem. Under this sufficient condition, the number of nonzero entries in the optimizer or solution vector increases monotonically when the hyperparameter decreases. We also generalize the result to the often used total variation case, where the $\ell$-1 norm is taken over the first order derivative of the solution vector. We prove that the proposed condition has intrinsic connections with the condition given by Donoho, et al \cite{Donoho08} and the positive cone condition by Efron {\it el al} \cite{Efron04}. However, the proposed condition does not need to assume the sparsity level of the signal as required by Donoho et al's condition, and is easier to verify than Efron, et al's positive cone condition when being used for practical applications.</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">Following up <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2011/04/cs-rosetta-table-between.html">on yesterday's connection between statistics and CS</a>, here are two Lasso papers:&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1104/1104.3398v1.pdf">Random lasso</a> by <a href="http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~wangs/">Sijian Wang</a>, <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/~bnan/">Bin Nan</a>, <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~saharon/">Saharon Rosset</a>, <a href="http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/">Ji Zhu</a>. The abstract reads:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">We propose a computationally intensive method, the random lasso method, for variable selection in linear models. The method consists of two major steps. In step 1, the lasso method is applied to many bootstrap samples, each using a set of randomly selected covariates. A measure of importance is yielded from this step for each covariate. In step 2, a similar procedure to the first step is implemented with the exception that for each bootstrap sample, a subset of covariates is randomly selected with unequal selection probabilities determined by the covariates' importance. Adaptive lasso may be used in the second step with weights determined by the importance measures. The final set of covariates and their coefficients are determined by averaging bootstrap results obtained from step 2. The proposed method alleviates some of the limitations of lasso, elastic-net and related methods noted especially in the context of microarray data analysis: it tends to remove highly correlated variables altogether or select them all, and maintains maximal flexibility in estimating their coefficients, particularly with different signs; the number of selected variables is no longer limited by the sample size; and the resulting prediction accuracy is competitive or superior compared to the alternatives. We illustrate the proposed method by extensive simulation studies. The proposed method is also applied to a Glioblastoma microarray data analysis.</div></blockquote><br />
<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1104/1104.3390v1.pdf">Improved variable selection with Forward-Lasso adaptive shrinkage</a> by <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~radchenk/">Peter Radchenko</a>, <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/">Gareth M. James</a>. The abstract reads;</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">Recently, considerable interest has focused on variable selection methods in regression situations where the number of predictors, $p$, is large relative to the number of observations, $n$. Two commonly applied variable selection approaches are the Lasso, which computes highly shrunk regression coefficients, and Forward Selection, which uses no shrinkage. We propose a new approach, "Forward-Lasso Adaptive SHrinkage" (FLASH), which includes the Lasso and Forward Selection as special cases, and can be used in both the linear regression and the Generalized Linear Model domains. As with the Lasso and Forward Selection, FLASH iteratively adds one variable to the model in a hierarchical fashion but, unlike these methods, at each step adjusts the level of shrinkage so as to optimize the selection of the next variable. We first present FLASH in the linear regression setting and show that it can be fitted using a variant of the computationally efficient LARS algorithm. Then, we extend FLASH to the GLM domain and demonstrate, through numerous simulations and real world data sets, as well as some theoretical analysis, that FLASH generally outperforms many competing approaches.</div></blockquote><br />

</ul><ul style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><li>The easiest way to grow your business is to find new customers.</li>
</ul><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I shared this image with you, back in February.&nbsp; I conducted an analysis of annual retention rates across fifty or so businesses ... as you can see, retention rates vary by +/- 10%, over time.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In other words, if you currently retain 40% of last year's buyers, you should not expect to find a marketing strategy that allows you to retain 80% of last year's buyers ... you may find a strategy that increases loyalty to 44%, or you may fail, causing loyalty to drop by 36%.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So much of the marketing literature focuses on loyalty.&nbsp; Here's the deal, folks.&nbsp; Loyalty matters much more if you are Wal-Mart, Starbucks, McDonalds, Nordstrom, Target, any place you purchase from at least once a month.&nbsp; In those situations, getting a customer to go from 12 purchases a year to 13 purchases a year is easy, and it has a huge impact on the profit and loss statement.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Now pretend you are Pottery Barn.&nbsp; Folks, you don't buy from Pottery Barn once a month, do you?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Here's another key point.&nbsp; The vast majority of us work for businesses that generate less than a billion dollars of sales a year, right?&nbsp; Well, in those cases, the best way to grow is to find new customers.&nbsp; Heck, I can recall being at Nordstrom back in 2005, and one of my analysts produced a slide that showed that we had something like 3-6% market share in womens apparel ... and we sold more than a couple billion dollars of womens apparel a year.&nbsp; We could still find new customers, and we were an eight billion dollar company.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You don't have 3-6% market share, in all likelihood, do you?&nbsp; That being the case, go out and find new customers.&nbsp; It's easier to find a new customer than it is to increase customer loyalty, and if you do find a way to increase customer loyalty, you'll increase loyalty among prior buyers and the new buyer you just acquired ... a multiplicative effect, right?! </span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/32202893-4884219145904065979?l=blog.minethatdata.com' alt='' /></div><div class="feedflare">

One thing that we have noticed is that the quality of the reviews can have an impact on product sales,<i> independently of the polarity of the review</i>.<br />
<br />
<b><i>High-quality reviews improve product sales</i></b><br />
<br />
A well-written review tends to inspire confidence about the product, even if the review is negative. Typically such reviews are perceived as objective and thorough. So, if we have a high-quality, but negative, review this may serve as a guarantee that the negative aspects of the product are not that bad after all. For example, a negative review such as "<i>horrible battery life... in my tests battery lasts barely longer than 24 hours...</i>" may be perceived as positive  by other customers that consider a 24-hour battery life to be more than sufficient.<br />
<br />
In our recent (<a href="http://www.www2011india.com/">award-winning</a>) <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~panos/publications/www2011.pdf">WWW2011 paper "Towards a Theory Model for Product Search"</a>, we noticed that demand for a hotel increases if the online reviews on TripAdvisor and Travelocity are well-written, without spelling errors; this holds no matter if the review is positive or negative. In our <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~panos/publications/tkde2010-usefulness.pdf">TKDE paper "Estimating the Helpfulness and Economic Impact of Product Reviews: Mining Text and Reviewer Characteristics"</a>, we observed similar trends for products sold and reviewed on Amazon.com.<br />
<br />
<b><i>And what can we do knowing this?</i></b><br />
<br />
Being in a business school, these findings were considered informative but not deeply interesting. Do not forget, the focus of researchers in business schools is <a href="http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2009/09/different-attitudes-of-computer.html">centered on causality and on policy-making</a>. Yes, we know that it is important for the reviews to be well-written and informative if we want the product to sell well. But if we cannot do anything about this, it is not deeply interesting. It is almost like knowing that during the cold months the demand for summer resorts drops!<br />
<br />
But here comes the twist...<br />
<br />
<b><i>The crowdsourcing solution</i></b><br />
<br />
Last week, over drinks during the WWW conference, I learned about a fascinating application of crowdsourcing that attacked exactly this issue.<br />
<br />
An online retailer noticed that indeed products with high-quality reviews are selling well. So, they decided to take action. They used Amazon Mechanical Turk to improve the quality of its reviews. Using the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/other-pubs/soylent.pdf">Find-Fix-Verify pattern</a>, they used Mechanical Turk to examine a few <b><i>millions </i></b>of product reviews. (Here are the archived versions of the HITs: <a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/79f44798e8c296e29bddbd3a3aa8f60a/">Find</a>, <a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/160L5FUZB7DDN03NIAB2D4J8HRZ022/">Fix</a>, <a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/1QPDXYWLI7K28IZ6MAP7WEO0N6V03B/">Verify</a>... and if you have not figured out the firm name by now, it is Zappos :-) ) For the reviews with mistakes, <b><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #660000;">they fixed the spelling and grammar errors! Thus they effectively improved the quality of the reviews on their website. And, correspondingly, they improved the demand for their products!</span></i></b><br />
<br />
While I do not know the exact revenue improvement, I was told that it was substantial. Given that the e-tailer  spent at least 10 cents per review, and that they examined approximately 5 million reviews, this is an expense of a few hundred thousand dollars. (My archive on MTurk-Tracker kind of confirms these numbers.) So, the expected revenue improvement should have been at least a few million dollars!<br />
<br />
Ethical? I would say yes. Notice that they are not fixing the polarity or the content of the reviews. They just change the language to be correct and error-free. I can see the counter-argument that the writing style allows us to judge if the review is serious or not. So, artificially improving the writing style may be considered as interference with the perceived objectivity of the user-generated reviews.<br />
<br />
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #660000;">But is it ingenious? Yes!</span></b> It is one of these solutions that is sitting in front of you but you just cannot see it. And this is what makes it ingenious.<br />

<div>Content:
I've been more <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/thoughts-on-residential-investment.html">upbeat</a> lately, but even as the economy recovers - and I think the recovery will continue - we need to remember a few facts.  <br />
<br />
There are currently 130.738 million payroll jobs in the U.S. (as of March 2011). There were 130.781 million payroll jobs in January 2000. So that is over eleven years with no increase in total payroll jobs.<br />
<br />
And the median household income in constant dollars was $49,777 in 2009. That is barely above the $49,309 in 1997, and below the $51,100 in 1998. (<a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/H06AR_2009.xls">Census data here in Excel</a>).<br />
<br />
Just a reminder that many Americans have been struggling for a decade or more.  The aughts were a lost decade for most Americans.<br />
<br />
And I'd like to think every U.S. policymaker wakes up every morning and reminds themselves of the following:<br />
<br />
There are currently 7.25 million fewer payroll jobs than before the recession started in 2007, with 13.5 million Americans currently unemployed. Another 8.4 million are working part time for economic reasons, and about 4 million more workers have left the labor force. Of those unemployed, 6.1 million have been unemployed for six months or more.<br />
<br />
So even as we start to discuss how to fix the structural budget deficit, and also to address the long term fiscal challenges from healthcare costs, we can't forget about all of these Americans.<br />

<div>Content:
I just wrote a new and longish survey on integer sorting algorithms for Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_sorting">Integer sorting</a>. Feedback, corrections, and tomatoes welcome.<br /><br />The Wikipedia articles on bucket sort, counting sort, and radix sort (that is, the integer sorting algorithms that are actually useful) still need help, by the way. The version of counting sort they describe is useless as part of radix sort because it only sorts numbers and not data with attached numeric keys. And the article on bucket sort focuses only on its applications to uniformly distributed real number keys, and doesn't even mention the fact that it can be used to sort integers in time linear in the number of items and the magnitude of the keys. In fact, it explicitly says, falsely, that bucket sort does not have the same worst case time bound as counting sort. So there's plenty more work to do in this area.</div>

<p>I recently ran across what can be considered the world&#8217;s oldest recorded statistic:</p>
<div id="attachment_70" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://cs.unm.edu/~terran/academic_blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/cuneiform.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-70" title="Cuneiform tablet, c. 3300 BC" src="http://cs.unm.edu/~terran/academic_blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/cuneiform-300x167.png" alt="Cuneiform tablet, c. 3300 BC" width="300" height="167" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet, c. 3300 BC, recording beer rations paid to workers.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet from about 5,000 years ago and is a sample of the earliest writing that we know.  From a machine learning/statistics point of view, however, the important thing is that it records <em>counts</em> &#8212; specifically, counts of beer rations paid to workers.  (Of course, to statisticians, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset" target="_blank">beer is important in its own right</a>.)  Counts being sufficient statistics for a number of interesting distributions, this is arguably the world&#8217;s oldest recorded statistic.</p>
<p>Good to know that the Mesopotamians were well on top of their probability and stats.  If only they hadn&#8217;t wacked out our time system by insisting on base 60&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks to the BBC&#8217;s excellent podcast program (programme, I suppose), <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/" target="_blank"><em>A History of the World in 100 Objects</em></a> for highlighting <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/TnAQ0B8bQkSJzKZFWo6F-g" target="_blank">this tablet</a>.  (And a number of other fascinating firsts in math and science history, among many other great slices of history in general.  I highly recommend this podcast.)</p>

<p>
I hate this graph.  OK, sure, I don't hate hate hate hate it:  it's not a 3-d exploding pie chart or anything.  It's not misleading, it's just extremely difficult to read.  Basically, you have to go back and forth between the colors and the labels and the countries and read it like a table.  OK, so here's the table:
<p>

<pre>
Average Hours Per Day Spent in Each Activity

           Work,   Unpaid  Eating, Personal
Country    study    work  sleeping   care   Leisure  Other

France       4        3       11       1       2       2
Germany      4        3       10       1       3       3
Japan        6        2       10       1       2       2
Britain      4        3       10       1       3       3
USA          5        3       10       1       3       2
Turkey       4        3       11       1       3       2
</pre>
<p>
Hmm, that didn't work too well.  Let's try subtracting the average from each column (for these six countries, the average (unweighted by population) time spent are 4.6 hours on paid work and study, 3.1 hours on unpaid work, 10.2 hours eating and sleeping, etc.):
<p>
<pre>
% Excess Hours Per Day Spent in Each Activity
(compared to avg over all countries)

           Work,   Unpaid  Eating, Personal
Country    study    work  sleeping   care   Leisure  Other

France     -10%       0%    +10%    +50%     -20%    -20%
Germany    -10%       0%      0%    -10%     +10%    +20%
Japan      +40%     -20%      0%      0%     -20%      0%
Britain      0%       0%      0%    -10%     +10%    +10%
USA          0%       0%      0%    -20%     +10%      0%
Turkey     -10%      10%      0%    -20%     +10%    -10%
</pre>
<p>
OK, the Japanese spent more time at work and the French spend more time grooming.  Beyond that, I don't see these numbers as particularly "stereotype confirming" (in Yglesias's words).  But I'm not fully up on my pop culture.  What is the stereotype about Turkish people?  I have the impression that in Dashiell Hammett's day they were called "Turks" and the detective was likely to be waylaid by one of them in a dark alley (this counts as "other activities," I believe), but I'm sure there are some new stereotypes I'm not aware of.  Blogging counts as "unpaid work," right?
<p>
Anyway, my first thought was that the above ugly graph should be redone as a line plot,  Here's what I came up with after an hour of work (yeah, yeah, I must have a lot of real work to do if I'm willing to put in this level of procrastination.  On the upside, I'm pretty high on the procrastination ladder if I spend an hour on an R script as a way of taking a break!):

Click</a> to see the full-sized version.
<p>
I could've done this a little better--in particular, the text is hard to read--but it's basically what I was envisioning.  [See P.S. below for something better.]  Also, I don't really know what to make of the ordering of the countries or the ordering of the categories on the x-axis--I just copied what the Economist graph did.
<p>
Why do I like my display better?  I like it because you can directly compare within a country--to see which activities are done more and which are done less, compared to the average.  And you can also compare between countries to see where people spend more time on any particular activity.  This between-country comparison would be clearer if we put all the lines on the same graph, but that looks a bit busy to me and I'm happier with the separate line plots.  If you had data on a lot of countries I could see batching them (for example, the lines for northern European countries on one plot, the lines for Southern European countries on another, and other plots for English-speaking countries, east Asian countries, south Asian countries, Middle Eastern/North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America).
<p>
I can see where the Economist's graphics designers were coming from with their plots.  In any country, the categories add to 24 hours, and the circle plot enforces that constraint.  (They could've made pie charts but everyone knows how bad that is.)  But there are a lot of categories so they needed colors and a legend.  And the circle arcs are hard to compare so they needed to put in the exact numbers.  The result, though, doesn't work for me.  I mean, sure, maybe it was fine--Matthew Yglesias is more in the target audience of the Economist than I am, and he liked the graph--but I think it could've been much better.  And I'm sure that if a graphics designer worked with me on it, the graph could be better still.
<p>
At some point this would represent a bit too much effort spent on one particular graph in a weekly newspaper.  But if we have enough good examples of these, they could represent a template that could be used all over.
<p>
<strong>P.S.</strong>  I was dissatisfied with my graph above because of lack of readability of the labels.  So I spent another <strike>45 minutes</strike>hour to make this:
<p>
<a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/mlm/times3.png"><img alt="times3.png" src="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/mlm/times3.png" width="565" height="232" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>
<p>
Wow!  All the information, it's clear and readable, and I got it in under 600 x 250 resolution on a png.  I like it.

<p><a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/mlm/excess_sleep_economist.png"><img alt="excess_sleep_economist.png" src="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/mlm/excess_sleep_economist.png" width="565" height="259" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>Here was my version:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/mlm/times3.png"><img alt="times3.png" src="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/mlm/times3.png" width="565" height="232" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>And here was the original:</p>

<p><img alt="uglyassgraph.gif" src="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/mlm/uglyassgraph.gif" width="500" height="429" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Compared to my graph, Evan's has better fonts, and that's important--good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I'm not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don't like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don't like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and - on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It's bad news.  Also I don't see any advantage <em>at all</em> to the prehensile tick marks.  On the other hand, if Evgn and I were working together on such a graph, we would probably come up with something better than either of us would make alone.</p>

<p>Here are a few kind words from one of the presenters, <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/johnjosephhorton/">John Horton</a>, Staff Economist at <a href="http://oDesk.com">oDesk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I really like how crowdsourcing/remote work is simultaneously a hot topic in both academia and industry/entrepreneurship. It&#8217;s fairly rare to have practitioners (startups, non-profits, etc.) interacting so positively and so frequently with researchers. This dynamic was definitely on display at the event. And kudos to CrowdFlower for sponsoring and promoting these &mdash; I think they&#8217;re doing a real service.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> And here&#8217;s what some of the attendees had to say.<br />
<span id="more-2365"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Loved the diversity of the use cases which made a strong case for the broader utility of crowdsourcing. Looking forward to attending and participating in more of these &mdash; I hope to also see more talks with a focus on enablement (tools, services) and collaboration beyond the case studies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A++ &mdash; I think this is relevant, timely and absolutely fascinating from a research perspective.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Very exciting. It&#8217;s amazing how interdisciplinary it is.”</p></blockquote>

The final short story, <em>Honey Pie</em>, was first published in <strong><em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a></em></strong> and is uniquely and outwordly beautiful.

<p>I gave the last lecture earlier today, wrapping up the semester. Here are the notes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://people.ee.duke.edu/~maxim/teaching/spring11/notes/regression.pdf">Regression with quadratic loss</a>, mostly in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, with and without regularization.</li>
<li><a href="http://people.ee.duke.edu/~maxim/teaching/spring11/notes/simulation.pdf">Case study: stochastic simulation via Rademacher bootstrap</a>, where I discuss the work of <a href="http://www.math.gatech.edu/users/vlad">Vladimir Koltchinskii</a> et al. on <a href="http://repository.unm.edu/handle/1928/53">efficient stopping algorithms</a> for Monte Carlo stochastic simulation. The idea is to keep sampling until the empirical Rademacher average falls below a given threshold. Once that happens, you stop and compute a minimizer of the empirical risk. The work of Koltchinskii et al. was in turn inspired by the ideas of <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~m.vidyasagar/">Mathukumalli Vidyasagar</a> on the use of statistical learning theory in <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~m.vidyasagar/E-Pubs/127.pdf">randomized algorithms for robust controller synthesis</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monday&#8217;s lecture was on stochastic gradient descent as an alternative to batch empirical risk minimization. I will post the notes soon.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfr%C3%A9d_R%C3%A9nyi">Alfr&eacute;d R&eacute;nyi</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xKc-AAAAIAAJ"><i>Dialogues on Mathematics</i></a>, Archimedes says this to King Hieron:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; Mathematics rewards only those who are interested in it not only for its rewards but also for itself. Mathematics is like your daughter, Helena, who suspects every time a suitor appears that he is not really in love with her, but is only interested in her because he wants to be the king&#8217;s son-in-law. She wants a husband who loves her for her own beauty, wit and charm, and not for the wealth and power he an get by marrying her. Similarly, mathematics reveals its secrets only to those who approach it with pure love, for its own beauty. Of course, those who do this are also rewarded with results of practical importance. But if somebody asks at each step, &#8220;What can I get out of this?&#8221; he will not get far. You remember I told you that the Romans would never be really successful in applying mathematics. Well, now you can see why: they are too practical.</p></blockquote>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/tvtw/11febtvt/index.cfm">reported</a> that vehicle miles driven in February were up 0.9% compared to February 2010:<br />
<blockquote>Travel on all roads and streets changed by +0.9% (2.0 billion vehicle miles) for February 2011 as compared with February 2010. Travel for the month is estimated to be 214.8 billion vehicle miles.<br />
<br />
Cumulative Travel for 2011 changed by +0.6% (2.8 billion vehicle miles).</blockquote><a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Retail#category=Retail&chart=MilesDrivenFeb2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1130,height=790,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Vehicle Miles" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1ziNZXcf1IU/Ta9If1GBXiI/AAAAAAAAKK4/WKFWSuWZg8c/s320/MilesDrivenFeb2011.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> <i><b><span style="font-size: 85%;">Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.</span></b></i><br />

This graph shows the rolling 12 month total vehicle miles driven. <br />
<br />
Note: in the early '80s, miles driven (rolling 12 months) stayed below the previous peak for 39 months. Currently miles driven has been below the previous peak for 39 months too - so this record will be broken in March!<br />

The DOT reported vehicle miles driven in February were up 0.9%.<br />
<br />
No signs of demand destruction yet, however in February U.S. oil prices <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=rclc1&f=m">averaged $90 per barrel</a>, and we might see $100+ oil lead to a decrease in driving in March or April.  <br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">[...] Spontaneous orders should be paired with the contrasting ideal type of an instrumental organization, characterized by having a specifiable goal, unequal status ranked on the basis of service to that goal and ease of replacing, and openness to cooperative endeavors justified by their utility in serving that goal. Once this distinction is understood, it is possible to analyze symbiotic and confictual relations between spontaneous orders and the instrumental organizations within them. This approach can be used in more empirical studies of spontaneous orders and the organizations within them, such as corporations and markets or political parties and democracies or research organizations and science. [...]; <em>Weber</em>&#8216;s concept of spontaneous order as described by <em>Reinhard Bendix</em>, &#8220;<em>Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait</em>&#8220;, 1959.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[...] It is an old idea that society is in a number of respects similar to an organism, a living system with its cells, metabolic circuits and systems. As an example, the army functions like an immune system, protecting the organism from invaders, while the government functions like the brain, steering the whole and making decisions. In this metaphor, different organizations or institutions play the role of organs, each fulfilling its particular function in keeping the system alive, an idea that can be traced back at least as far as <em>Aristotle</em>, being a major inspiration for the founding fathers of sociology, such as <em>Comte</em>, <em>Durkheim</em> and especially <em>Spencer</em> [...], in <em>Vitorino Ramos</em>, <em>On the Implicit and on the Artificial &#8211; Morphogenesis and Emergent Aesthetics in Autonomous Collective Systems</em>, in ARCHITOPIA Book, Art, Architecture and Science, INSTITUT D&#8217;ART CONTEMPORAIN, J.L.

And they do this whether you like it or not.</p>
<blockquote><p>The more fundamental problem is that Apple are collecting this information at all. Cell-phone providers collect similar data almost inevitably as part of their operations, but it’s kept behind their firewall. It normally requires a court order to gain access to it, whereas this is available to anyone who can get their hands on your phone or computer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Allan and Warden provide an open-source application, <a href="http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker/">iPhone Tracker</a>, that maps that data. The good news is that the data doesn't seem go to be anywhere other than your own backups and devices. Privacy concerns aside, this kind of makes me wish I had an iPhone; although I suspect my map would be painfully boring.</p>

<p><img align="left" style="margin-right: 1em;" src="http://www.igvita.com/posts/11/ml-ai.png">Clever algorithms and pages of mathematical formulas filled with probability and optimization theory are usually the associations that get invoked when you ask someone to describe the fields of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a>. Granted, there is definitely an abundance of both, but this mental picture also tends to obscure some of the more interesting and recent developments in these fields: data driven learning, and the fact that you are often better off developing simple intuitive insights instead of complicated domain models which are meant to represent every attribute of the problem.</p>
<p>Back in early 2001, Eric Brill and Michele Banko published an incredibly interesting paper (<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=68846">Mitigating the Paucity of Data Problem</a>), which showed that simply increasing the training set by orders of magnitude yielded significant improvements in the performance of common Machine Learning algorithms. <strong>In fact, in certain cases, you are simply better off working on getting more data, then spending your time on improving the algorithm</strong> - think about that for a minute! We can even take this model to an extreme: <strong>data <em>is</em> the algorithm</strong>. How does Google Translate support 60+ languages? They don't employ any linguists. Instead, the translation is done through pure data-driven learning.</p>
<h4><strong>GoGaRuCo 2010: Machine Learning Trends & Patterns</strong></h4>
<p align="center"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22513786?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="620" height="349" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The goal for my presentation at GoGaRuCo 2010 (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/igrigorik/intelligent-ruby-machine-learning">slides</a>) was to highlight the following themes: first, the algorithm is important, but we tend to overemphasize its importance; simple, intuitive insights are usually the underpinnings of much more (seemingly) complicated algorithms; data can be an algorithm in by itself. None of these ideas are novel or my own. In fact, much of the recent credit goes to Peter Norvig for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU8DcBF-qo4">popularizing</a> <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/13863110/The-Unreasonable-Effectiveness-of-Data">these ideas</a> and driving their adoption at Google (<a href="http://translate.google.com/#">Translate</a>, <a href="http://labs.google.com/sets">Sets</a>, <a href="http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html">Spelling correction</a>, and so on) and throughout the industry at large. </p>
<h4><strong>"It's really quiet simple"</strong></h4>
<p>Perhaps the largest mental barrier for most developers is that Machine Learning "is hard". <a href="http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/jeff_jonas/2011/04/data-beats-math.html">It doesn't have to be</a>. In fact, <strong>having an intuitive mental model is often more helpful than having a "tight proof of the error boundary" when it comes to implementing one of these systems in real life</strong>.</p>
<p>One of my favorite examples, and one that I shared in my presentation, is that of clustering. Namely, to perform a clustering, we need to define a function to measure the "pairwise distance" between all pairs of objects. Can you think of a generic way to do so? How about using your favorite Zlib library?</p>

<p>The insight is simple: if any two objects, whatever data they main contain, have overlapping data inside, then the compressed filesize of these two files when they are joined together should be smaller than the sum of their individually compressed files. Work through a few examples in your head. Once you prove it to yourself, it will seem remarkably simple. Best of all, this is a generic insight which allows you to cluster virtually any type of data. In fact, the example above will faithfully detect and cluster different languages, separate png and mp3 files, and so on.</p>
<h4><strong>Ensembles & Collaborative learning</strong></h4>
<p>That is not to say that having a <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2007/01/15/svd-recommendation-system-in-ruby/">solid</a> <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2007/04/16/decision-tree-learning-in-ruby/">understanding</a> of the <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2008/01/07/support-vector-machines-svm-in-ruby/">fundamentals</a> of ML and AI fields is not important - it absolutely is. However, given a choice between a more complicated algorithm and more data, try more data first.

<div>Content:
Moody's <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-22/u-s-commercial-property-prices-fell-for-second-straight-month-in-january.html">reported</a> today that the Moody’s/REAL All Property Type Aggregate Index declined 3.3% in February. Note: Moody's CRE price index is a repeat sales index like Case-Shiller - but there are far fewer commercial sales and there are a large percentage of distressed sales - and that can impact prices and make the index very volatile.<br />
<br />
Below is a comparison of the Moodys/REAL Commercial Property Price Index (CPPI) and the Case-Shiller composite 20 index. Beware of the "Real" in the title - this index is not inflation adjusted. <blockquote>The Moody’s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index fell 3.3 percent from January and 4.9 percent from a year earlier. It’s up 0.8 percent from an eight-year low in August, Moody’s said in a statement today.</blockquote><a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?CRE#category=CRE&amp;chart=MoodysCPPIFeb2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1210,height=750,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="CRE and Residential Price indexes" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kbIHGWj1AJU/Ta8hawNqslI/AAAAAAAAKK0/dpMb3_gSAe4/s320/MoodysCPPIFeb2011.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> <i><b><span style="font-size: 85%;">Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.</span></b></i><br />
<br />
CRE prices only go back to December 2000. The Case-Shiller Composite 20 residential index is in blue (with Dec 2000 set to 1.0 to line up the indexes). <br />
<br />
According to Moody's, CRE prices are down 4.9% from a year ago and down about 44.7% from the peak in 2007.  Prices are just above the post-bubble low last August - and about at the levels of 2002.<br />

<p>
Some notes:
<p>
1.  Yes, I know the code is ugly.  To start, I should've entered the data into a file rather than put them in the R script.  And the sloppiness goes on from there.
<p>
2.  On the plus side, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to make the second, coefplot-style, graph.
<p>
3.  The biggest kluge with the coefplot graph was that there was exactly as much space for the words on the left as for each of the six country graphs.  My limiting factor was how much space I needed for the names of the activities.
<p>
4.  Rather than make the graphs using png() or pdf() or whatever, I made them on the console and then resized the graphics device to make the images more compact.  This is a convenient feature in R:  the image changes size but the text fonts and sizes remain fixed.  When I try to make graphs directly using png() or pdf(), I have to spend a lot of time monkeying around with the font sizes.
<p>
5.  A commenter suggested making the negative values red and the positive values blue in the bar chart.  I tried it but I didn't like how it looked.  My eye got drawn to the pattern of red and blue, and I found it hard to follow.
<p>
6.  The bars are narrower than you might be used to seeing.  I think narrow bars work well here.  When you have fat bars your eye gets drawn to the negative spaces between the bars.
<p>
7.  I was surprised how well it worked to plot absolute rather than relative differences.  Absolute differences are easier to undersand; but, in addition, in this case I think they're more informative too.
<p>
8. Perhaps we can formalize the ideas in these plots and put them into the arm package along with everything else.

<div>Content:
Earlier the NAR <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/march-existing-home-sales-510-million.html">released</a> the existing home sales data for March; here are a couple more graphs ...<br />
<br />
The first graph shows the year-over-year (YoY) change in reported existing home inventory and months-of-supply. Inventory is not seasonally adjusted, so it really helps to look at the YoY change. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Existing-Home#category=Existing-Home&amp;chart=EHSYoYInventoryMarch2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1130,height=770,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Year-over-year Inventory" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RA3j84ChbgI/Ta7tgwCRmjI/AAAAAAAAKKw/KdxVUO0SSaY/s320/EHSYoYInventoryMarch2011.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> <i><b><span style="font-size: 85%;">Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.</span></b></i><br />
<br />
Although inventory increased from February to March (as usual), inventory decreased 2.1% year-over-year in March (from March 2010). This is the second consecutive month with a small YoY decrease in inventory.<br />
<br />
Inventory should increase over the next few months (the normal seasonal pattern), and the YoY change is something to watch closely this year. Inventory is already very high, and any YoY increase in inventory would put more downward pressure on house prices.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Existing-Home#category=Existing-Home&amp;chart=EHSNSAMarch2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1130,height=770,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Existing Home Sales NSA" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UdlR4d05oSw/Ta7tgX31YEI/AAAAAAAAKKs/O2_lREcDbC4/s320/EHSNSAMarch2011.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> The second graph shows existing home sales Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA).<br />
<br />
The red columns in January, February and March are for 2011. <br />
<br />
Sales NSA are below the tax credit boosted level of sales in March 2010, but above the level of March sales in 2008 and 2009. <br />
<br />
The bottom line: March is the beginning of the selling season, and sales activity (so far) is above the 2008 and 2009 levels. Much of this activity is from all cash-sales (both investors and homebuyers). The NAR reported "All-cash sales were at a record market share of 35 percent in March, up from 33 percent in February; they were 27 percent in March 2010."<br />
<br />
The NAR also mentioned: "Distressed homes – typically sold at discounts in the vicinity of 20 percent – accounted for a 40 percent market share in March, up from 39 percent in February and 35 percent in March 2010." A higher percentage of distressed sales probably means lower prices - and we should expect the repeat sales indexes to show further price declines in March.<br />
<br />
The year-over-year decline in inventory will put less downward pressure on house prices, although the level is still very high (and this is just the visible inventory). <br />
<br />
Note: The Case-Shiller price index will be released next Tuesday (April 26th), and is released with a significant lag. The Case-Shiller report will be for February (average of three months) - and the NAR report, with the high level of distressed sales and cash buyers, suggests further price declines in March.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Link to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculatedriskblog</a>!<img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10004977-1609425226174749920?l=www.calculatedriskblog.com' alt='' /></div></div>

<p>Most presentations of Bayesian statistics I&#8217;ve seen start with elementary examples of Bayes&#8217; Theorem. And most of these use the canonical example of <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/rarediseases.pdf">testing for rare diseases</a>. But the connection between these examples and Bayesian statistics is not obvious at first. Maybe this isn&#8217;t the best approach.</p>
<p>What if we <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743269519/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theende-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0743269519">begin with the end in mind</a>? Bayesian calculations produce posterior probability distributions on parameters. An effective way to teach Bayesian statistics might be to start there. Suppose we had probability distributions on our parameters. Never mind where they came from. Never mind classical objections that say you can&#8217;t do this. What if you could? If you had such distributions, what could you do with them?</p>
<p>For starters, point estimation and interval estimation become trivial. You could, for example, use the distribution mean as a point estimate and the area between two quantiles as an interval estimate. The distributions tell you far more than  point estimates or interval estimates could; these estimates are simply summaries of the information contained in the distributions.</p>
<p>It makes logical sense to start with Bayes&#8217; Theorem since that&#8217;s the tool used to construct posterior distributions. But I think it makes <em>pedagogical</em> sense to start with the posterior distribution and work backward to how one would come up with such a thing.</p>
<p>Bayesian statistics is so named because Bayes&#8217; Theorem is essential to its calculations. But that&#8217;s a little like classical statistics Central Limitist statistics because it relies heavily on the Central Limit Theorem.</p>
<p>The key idea of Bayesian statistics is to represent all uncertainty by probability distributions. That idea can be obscured by an early emphasis on calculations.</p>

Copyright © 2011 http://jtonedm.com James Taylor<br><br /><p>I got a demo of the Talent Analytics platform recently. <a href="http://www.talentanalytics.com/">Talent Analytics</a> is a company that develops solutions that provide relevant information to help companies anticipate the impact talent has on their business goals. Advisor, their platform, is a web-based SaaS platform.</p>
<p>At the top level the product allows one or more organizations to be managed &#8211; many users of the platform are management consulting firms and they typically have multiple clients. Talent data is collected from each company with data being managed around the people in that company, grouped by role or functional area. The people being managed might be employees or candidates. Data is gathered about these people through a 61 question survey that takes a little less than 25 minutes to complete. The questions were built based on psychometrics and other research and are periodically validated statistically. The questions are randomly displayed and responders rank the 4 answers presented from most to least appropriate. The results are processed using the <a href="http://www.talentanalytics.com/about/technology/">various algorithms</a> that Talent Analytics have developed. Questions cross-check each other and are designed to catch both people trying to game the survey and those who are just randomly picking answers.</p>
<p>For each person the Talent Analytics algorithms create a series of analytic scores or metrics. For instance they have a set of scores for the way people think about business identified with as DISC –Decisive (directive v collaborative), Interactive (social v reserved), Stabilizing (likes predictability v likes change)and Cautious (rule follower v informal). These scores give a quick overview of people’s performance style &#8211; how they would like to work. They also calculate a set of Performance Styles values for how people feel they are performing in their current role (people often behave differently than their preferred style perhaps because they believe they need a certain performance style to be successful). Presenting this data in a simple table immediately shows interesting things about a selected group of people: A large gap between preferred and actual style is likely to cause stress, a team member with a score that is very different from the average of a group might not be a good fit for that team and so on.</p>
<p>They also measure ambitions on 7 different dimensions. This shows the biggest drivers for people in their own assessment of themselves. Each person ends up with a ranked list of the 7 dimensions showing the relative importance to them of Economics or results; Altruism; Theoretical or love to learn/teach; Authoritative or mission focused; Political or competitive; Individual or non-conformist; and Creative who like being out of the box. These too are presented in tabular form and again the differences in attitude across a team, for instance, can be telling.</p>
<p>Both the 4 Performance Styles and 7 ambitions data are designed to be stable – they are things that cannot easily be changed or trained for. The four Performance Style parameters are genuinely independent variables &#8211; Talent Analytics have done extensive analysis to make sure that values of one don’t predict the others.</p>
<p>Besides the simple tables showing a group or team, this data can be presented in various graphical formats. Showing it on a graph can show the differences between team members, between candidates or between existing teams and candidates for the team. This can be used to compare candidates, to see how a team clusters, to see how top or bottom performers look (they have found that top and bottom performers often show particular patterns within a group or role) and so on. It can also be used to compare people from multiple teams that need to work together or even compare teams in different companies to see if their relative performance can be explained.</p>
<p>The tool also allows the definition of benchmarks. There represent role requirements in terms of these various dimensions. People can then be compared with these benchmarks to see how well matched they are. You could therefore see, for instance, which sales reps have a style that is the best match to the benchmark for a sales manager rather than simply promoting the sales rep with the best results (who might be terrible fit). The tool explains gaps between a person and the benchmark and these explanations can include custom questions to draw out why the gap might be there (for use in hiring) or what might be doable to help manage the gap with training or mentoring (helping someone tone down their aggressive style say). Of course people who show a big gap against one benchmark could be compared to other benchmarks in the organization to see where they might fit better too, allowing for coherent reassignment of people when they don’t fit in their current role. Talent Analytics’ partners often focus in a specific vertical giving them unique insights into what is an appropriate benchmark for a role in that vertical.</p>
<p>Talent Analytics have found that, while the tool does not change people, comparing teams and people this way helps give them concrete things to discuss. This helps groups or individuals who must collaborate but struggle to do so to get out of name calling and complaining and into constructive discussions of how to manage the difference in perspectives. In this vein the tool also offers an overall dashboard with dials showing the overall pattern of people in a company or a division or a team. The dials show the range of values within which groups fall across the company, allowing the differences between groups to be clearly seen. This could also be used to <a href="http://www.talentanalytics.com/blog/using-a-talent-analytics-dashboard-to-visually-forecast-team-behavior/">compare the approach of different groups</a> that would have to work together if a proposed merger was to go through, helping with planning and perhaps even valuation.</p>
<p>One neat feature that is coming soon is what they call an <a href="http://www.talentanalytics.com/about/business-applications/change-management/advisors-cuecard/">Enterprise CUEcard</a>™. The idea is to provide a Talent Analytics vCard that can be merged with a typical company address book profile. The CUEcard contains advice about how to interact with each person (“Don’t patronize him with incentives”, “Don’t be sloppy” etc). The tool will also be able to generate a <a href="http://www.talentanalytics.com/about/business-applications/change-management/advisors-team-playbook/">Team Playbook</a>™ &#8211; a PDF with everyone listed, overviews of the Performance Styles distribution of people in the playbook and tips and traps for communicating with each person. Again these might be all employees, a multi-company team in a Joint Venture or a new team that will be formed out of a merger.</p>
<p>To date Talent Analytics have mostly worked with companies in the 1,000-8000 employee range but the size of customer is growing and they have, for instance, a bank using Advisor for call center representatives. This bank had 100% turnover, often losing people during the training, and this meant they were hiring and training (and losing) 30,000 people a year. Some companies just use it on their executive team and leadership and many others start there and work down the organization. Talent Analytics continually investigate new statistical techniques and are working on questionnaires that are more dynamic, that learn from results and ask different questions as they go.</p>
<p>One feature I particularly liked is that the analytic scores are easily extractable and can be integrated and used alongside other data. This would allow, for instance, predictive analytics that used Advisor data and other HR or performance data. More on this in a future blog post.</p>

The NAR reports: <a href="http://www.realtor.org/press_room/news_releases/2011/04/rise_march">Existing-Home Sales Rise in March</a><br />
<blockquote>Existing-home sales1, which are completed transactions that include single-family, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, increased 3.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.10 million in March from an upwardly revised 4.92 million in February, but are 6.3 percent below the 5.44 million pace in March 2010.<br />
...<br />
All-cash sales were at a record market share of 35 percent in March, up from 33 percent in February; they were 27 percent in March 2010. Investors accounted for 22 percent of sales activity in March, up from 19 percent in February; they were 19 percent in March 2010.<br />
...<br />
Total housing inventory at the end of March rose 1.5 percent to 3.55 million existing homes available for sale, which represents an 8.4-month supply4 at the current sales pace, compared with a 8.5-month supply in February. </blockquote><a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Existing-Home#category=Existing-Home&amp;chart=EHSSalesMarch2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1130,height=770,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Existing Home Sales" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lTtzcqTZSVI/Ta7oETo3kTI/AAAAAAAAKKo/ioGYOiFDhHM/s320/EHSSalesMarch2011.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> <i><b><span style="font-size: 85%;">Click on graph for larger image in new window.</span></b></i><br />

This graph shows existing home sales, on a Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR) basis since 1993. <br />

Sales in March 2011 (5.10 million SAAR) were 3.7% higher than last month, and were 6.3% lower than March 2010. <br />

<br />
According to the NAR, inventory increased to 3.549 million in March from 3.498 million in February. <br />
<br />
Inventory is not seasonally adjusted and there is a clear seasonal pattern with inventory peaking in the summer and declining in the fall and winter. Inventory will probably increase significantly over the next several months.<br />
<br />

<br />
Months of supply decreased to 8.4 months in March, down from 8.5 months in February. The months of supply will probably increase over the next few months as inventory increases. This is higher than normal.<br />
<br />
<b>Special Note:</b> <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/01/pending-home-sales-index-increases-2-in.html">Back in January</a>, I noted that it appeared the NAR had overestimated sales by 5% or so in 2007, and that the errors had increased since then (perhaps 10% or 15% or more in 2009 and 2010). I reported in January that the NAR was working on benchmarking existing home sales for earlier years with other industry data, and I expected "this effort will lead to significant downward revisions to previously reported sales". The numbers reported today were <i>estimated using the old method</i> and will probably be revised down significantly, but they are still useful on a month-to-month basis.<br />
<br />
These sales numbers were above the consensus of 5.0 million SAAR, and are about what I expected (Lawler's forecast was 5.08 million). I'll have more soon.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Link to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculatedriskblog</a>!<img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10004977-5302783293121735301?l=www.calculatedriskblog.com' alt='' /></div></div>

<p>On May 5th the UK will vote in a referendum for only the second time ever. (The first time was in 1975, when we voted on whether to remain in the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called.) Now we have a chance to decide whether to retain our current voting system, misleadingly known as First Past The Post, or whether to switch to the Alternative Vote. Let me come clean straight away. Although in this post I shall try to write dispassionately about these two voting systems, my actual attitude is anything but dispassionate: I have yearned for a better voting system ever since I have had any political awareness at all, and am steeling myself for what is probably going to be a huge disappointment when the country votes for the status quo. And I am writing this post in the genuine hope of making a difference. Since it is extremely hard to change anybody&#8217;s mind in politics, I think the best I can hope for is to persuade somebody to vote yes (the question will be phrased in such a way that &#8220;yes&#8221; means you want AV and &#8220;no&#8221; means you want FPTP) who might otherwise not have bothered to vote at all. This is a mathematics blog, so I will give this post a mildly mathematical slant, but all I really mean by this is that I know when I write that a typical reader of this post will be mathematically literate, which may make the post different in tone from how it would be if I were writing for a more general readership.<br />
<span id="more-2756"></span></p>
<p><strong>A little history.</strong></p>
<p>Let us look at the election results from 1979, when Margaret Thatcher first came to power, to 1997, when Tony Blair first won. These are results of elections held under FPTP, the system where the country is divided into constituencies, each of which gets a seat in parliament, and the seat goes to whichever candidate gets the most votes in the constituency.</p>
<p>In 1979 the results of the three main parties were as follows: </p>
<p>Conservatives, 43.9% of the vote, 339 seats</p>
<p>Labour, 36.9% of the vote, 269 seats</p>
<p>Liberals, 13.8% of the vote, 11 seats.</p>
<p>So the Conservatives got a little over three times as many votes as the Liberals, and just over thirty times as many seats. To put that another way, it took about ten times as many votes (on average) to elect a Liberal MP as it took to elect a Conservative MP.</p>
<p>The next election was an interesting one. A couple of years into Thatcher&#8217;s premiership, a new political party, the Social Democratic Party, was formed by moderate Labour Party politicians who did not like the lurch to the left that had taken place under Labour&#8217;s then leader Michael Foot. Within a short time, they were coming top in opinion polls, but this did not last until the General Election, largely because the Falklands War gave Mrs Thatcher a huge boost to her popularity. It was clear that the Social Democrats had a lot in common with the Liberals (with whom they were later to merge), so they agreed not to stand against each other at the 1983 General Election, instead forming the Alliance. The results of the election were as follows:</p>
<p>Conservatives, 42.4% of the vote, 397 seats</p>
<p>Labour, 27.6% of the vote, 209 seats</p>
<p>SDP/Liberal Alliance, 25.4% of the vote, 23 seats.</p>
<p>Let us note a couple of anomalies in this result. Most strikingly, the Alliance got almost as many votes as the Labour party but Labour got roughly nine times as many seats. Second most strikingly, the Conservative share of the vote went down slightly, but they now had a truly thumping majority, much higher than after the previous election.</p>
<p>How was this possible? Well, under FPTP, if you want to maximize the number of seats you will get for a given share of the vote, then there are two things you must avoid. Most importantly, you don&#8217;t want to spread your vote about too evenly: if you get 28% of the vote in every single seat, you probably won&#8217;t win a single seat. So FPTP penalizes parties that have a uniform appeal throughout the country. This suggests that what you want is for your support to be geographically concentrated, and indeed that is the case up to a point, but you must also avoid having too many seats where you have an overwhelming majority: if you get 90% in a seat, then at least 40% of those votes would have been more useful to you if they had been cast in other constituencies. So FPTP favours parties with support that is geographically concentrated but not <em>too</em> concentrated. The Alliance&#8217;s support was dispersed, and the consequences for them at the election were disastrous.</p>
<p>The second anomaly &#8212; the hugely increased majority for the Conservatives despite a drop in their share of the vote &#8212; was a consequence of a phenomenon that frequently arises in this country under FPTP, the splitting of the left. At that time, both Labour and the Alliance were clearly on the left (the Alliance was much less so, but they were certainly not in favour of the Thatcherite programme that the country officially voted for) so there was a clear majority in favour of broadly left-wing politics. However, that majority was roughly evenly split between two parties, so there were many constituencies where the Conservatives won the seat with well under half the vote.</p>
<p>The next election, in 1987, was similar but less extreme. </p>
<p>Conservatives, 42.2% of the vote, 376 seats</p>
<p>Labour, 30.8% of the vote, 229 seats</p>
<p>Alliance, 22.6% of the vote, 22 seats.</p>
<p>In 1990 Margaret Thatcher resigned and John Major took over. The next election was in 1992 and the results were as follows. By this time, the SDP and the Liberals had merged to become the Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p>Conservatives, 41.9% of the vote, 336 seats</p>
<p>Labour, 34.4% of the vote, 271 seats</p>
<p>Liberal Democrats, 17.8% of the vote, 20 seats.</p>
<p>Something odd happened here too: the Conservative vote dropped by 0.3% but their majority went down very substantially (which led to numerous rebellions throughout the parliament, particularly on the thorny subject of Britain&#8217;s relationship with Europe). The explanation is that the split on the left, which still existed, was less severe.</p>
<p>Next was 1997, the year that Blair was elected.</p>
<p>Labour, 43.2% of the vote, 418 seats</p>
<p>Conservatives, 30.7% of the vote, 165 seats</p>
<p>Liberal Democrats, 16.8% of the vote, 46 seats.</p>
<p>Again there are some strange aspects of this result. The Liberal Democrats had their best result for many decades despite their lowest vote percentage in all the elections I have discussed. (However, their share of seats was still significantly lower than it would have been under a proportional system.) Labour got about two and a half times as many seats as the Conservatives for under one and a half times as many votes, and got a massive majority with only 43.2% of the vote.</p>
<p><strong>Does FPTP reflect the will of the voters? </strong></p>
<p>It is very easy to slip into thinking that the answer to this question is yes by definition: whatever the result of an election, the interpretation given to it by the media will be that &#8220;the voters have said&#8221; whatever FPTP deems them to have said. For instance, when I think back to the election that John Major won, my impression of it is that the mood of the country swung against the Tories, but not by enough to unseat them. I had completely forgotten that the Tory vote remained virtually unchanged from the previous election and that it was only the change to how the votes on the left split that caused the Tories to lose seats. So a more correct interpretation of the result is that the Labour party had become more electable again, improving its appeal relative to that of the Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it is possible to defend the view that the 1983 election reflected the will of the voters: over a quarter of voters ended up being represented by about 3% of MPs, and the representatives of just over 40% of voters were given free rein to continue with a program that was (I am pretty sure) bitterly opposed by the majority. </p>
<p>It is reasonable to say that when Tony Blair was elected, the result reflected the national mood to some extent: the Conservatives had been in power for 17 years and John Major&#8217;s government had lost the country&#8217;s respect after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday">Black Wednesday</a>, from which it never really recovered. However, it is not reasonable to say that the size of Blair&#8217;s majority &#8212; he had almost two thirds of all seats &#8212; reflected the national mood. The large swing was reflected, but in a distorting mirror that greatly expanded it.</p>
<p>Similarly, since the Liberals, or Liberal Democrats, always come a distant third in elections, one naturally thinks of them as a minor party, but their share of the vote, often over 20%, is anything but minor.</p>
<p>And I haven&#8217;t mentioned elections from further back that were won by parties that did not get the most votes. In 1951, the Conservatives under Winston Churchill won an absolute majority of seats (though a small one) with 48.0% of the vote. In the same election, Labour under Clement Attlee got 48.8% of the vote.</p>
<p><strong>Do people&#8217;s votes reflect the will of the voters?</strong></p>
<p>This question looks a bit silly. Is the answer not trivially yes? </p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t. Under FPTP, we often receive election literature that looks something like this.<br />
<img src="http://gowers.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/graph10_1.gif?w=160" alt="Election propaganda" /><br />
That was a bar chart put out by the Liberal Democrats in Cambridge at the last general election. They reasoned that Conservative voters would prefer the Liberal Democrats to Labour, so tried to persuade potential Conservative voters to vote Liberal Democrat on the grounds that voting Conservative might well let in Labour. It is only fair to say that this argument has been employed much more often in the past against the Liberal Democrats. The slogan, &#8220;A vote for the Liberals is a wasted vote,&#8221; used to be heard frequently at elections.</p>
<p>But the general point is that under FPTP it is often rational to vote for a party that is not your first choice. This is a very important point, since it hugely weakens one of the main arguments of those who are campaigning against AV. I will come back to this later.</p>
<p>(In parentheses, let me remark that the result in Cambridge at the last election was</p>
<p>Liberal Democrat  19,621  (39.1% of vote)<br />
Conservative 12,829  (25.6% of vote)<br />
Labour 12,174  (24.3% of vote)<br />
Green 3,804<br />
UKIP 1,195<br />
others 507</p>
<p>So it seems that Conservative voters were not persuaded to vote tactically.)</p>
<p>Going back to some of the results under FPTP, one cannot know how many people voted for parties that were not their first choice. However, all the main political parties urge people to vote tactically in individual constituencies (even if the senior politicians do not always admit it), and it is obvious that many people heed the call. I cannot prove it, but I find it pretty obvious that some of the results from the 1980s that were so unfair to the Liberals, the Alliance and the Liberal Democrats were in fact more unfair even than they looked, since many people would have voted for them if they had not been persuaded by the wasted-vote argument.</p>
<p><strong>Is AV any better?</strong></p>
<p>So far all I have done is discuss some of the deficiencies of FPTP. (OK, perhaps &#8220;deficiencies&#8221; isn&#8217;t a neutral enough word. I have been discussing some of the interesting phenomena that can occur, and often have occurred, under FPTP.) But does AV do any better? </p>
<p>The first thing to say is that AV is not proportional representation. Under AV it is still possible for a party to get a share of seats that is very different from its share of the votes. Before I say any more about AV, let me quickly say what it is (though I imagine that most people interested enough to get this far know already). Under AV, you don&#8217;t just vote for one candidate. Instead, you number the candidates 1,2,3 until you no longer wish to express a preference. For instance, if you are a UKIP supporter (the United Kingdom Independence Party is a right-wing party that wants Britain to leave the European Union) then you might put UKIP first and the Conservatives second, but not express a preference between Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, etc. </p>
<p>When the votes are counted, the following algorithm is applied.</p>
<p>1. Count all first-preference votes not yet counted.<br />
2. If some party has over 50% of first-preference votes, then HALT. (That party then wins.)<br />
3. Take the party with the smallest number of first-preference votes and change each vote for that party by removing the first-preference votes and turning <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='k' title='k' class='latex' />th-preference votes into <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28k-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='(k-1)' title='(k-1)' class='latex' />th-preference votes for each <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='k.' title='k.' class='latex' /><br />
4. Remove that party from the list of preferences of all other voters.<br />
5. GOTO 1. </p>
<p>As an example, suppose that the parties in your constituency are Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, UKIP and the Greens. Suppose that your preferences are Green, Lib Dem, Labour, Conservative, UKIP in that order. Then if no party has over 50% and UKIP comes bottom, nothing happens to your voting paper. If after the next count (when the UKIP second preferences have become first preferences) it is still the case that no party has over 50%, and this time the Greens are eliminated, then your preferences are shunted up by 1, so they now read Lib Dem, Labour, Conservative (UKIP and the Greens having been eliminated). Perhaps by this stage Labour have reached the magic 50% (with a boost from those Greens who put Labour as their second choice). Or perhaps no party has and the Liberal Democrats are now third. In that case, your preferences become Labour over the Conservatives, and one or other of those will now have over 50%. </p>
<p>One of the criticisms of proportional representation is that it weakens the constituency link: it is hard to have a fully proportional system where each MP represents his or her constituency. AV does not suffer from this defect, since there is still a constituency system. But the price for that is that there is no obvious reason to expect AV to be proportional. So why is it any better than FPTP (from the point of view of representing the will of the voters)? </p>
<p>The reason is that under AV there is far less reason to vote tactically. Under AV, a vote for a minor party is not a wasted vote: you can express your preference for the minor party while still having an opportunity to decide which of the major parties you would prefer. For instance, you could vote Green and not worry that you were letting in the Conservatives, or you could vote UKIP without thinking that you might let in Labour. And if you are an anyone-but-the-Tories person, you can express that sentiment without being forced to guess which party has the best chance of defeating them.</p>
<p><strong>Is tactical voting eliminated under AV?</strong></p>
<p>The scope for tactical voting is greatly reduced under AV, because the wasted-vote argument no longer applies. But it is possible to come up with circumstances under which it would make sense even with AV to vote tactically. I&#8217;m not sure these circumstances would be relevant: typically they would require voters to know more about the preferences of other voters than they are ever likely to in practice. But let me give what I think is the simplest situation where tactical voting would in theory be rational under AV. To make it easier to understand, I&#8217;ll use actual parties, and will try to make people&#8217;s second preferences as plausible as possible given their first preferences.</p>
<p>Suppose you are voting in a constituency where the Conservatives typically get around 40% of first-preference votes, Labour get around 30%, the Liberal Democrats get around 30%, and the other parties get almost nothing. (This is not entirely realistic, but it could well be the situation after all but three parties have been eliminated.) Suppose you are an ardent supporter of the Conservatives. What should you do? Well, you might judge that Liberal Democrat voters are more likely to put the Conservatives as their second choice than Labour voters are. If that is what you think, then paradoxically it might make sense to vote <em>Labour</em> (the party you like least out of the three) so that when the second-choice votes are counted the Conservatives will get enough to push them over 50%. To see how this could work, imagine that the second-preference votes for Labour split 5:1 in favour of the Liberal Democrats (that is, 25% of voters have Labour first and Lib Dems second, and 5% of voters have Labour first and the Conservatives second), while the second-preference votes for the Lib Dems split 3:2 in favour of Labour (so 18% of voters have Lib Dems first and Labour second, while 12% of voters have Lib Dems first and the Conservatives second). </p>
<p>Labour and the Lib Dems are neck and neck. If the Lib Dems come second, then Labour will be eliminated and the total percentages of votes will be 45% for the Conservatives and 55% for the Liberal Democrats. If Labour come second, then the Lib Dems will be eliminated and the percentages will be 52% for the Conservatives and 48% for Labour.</p>
<p>So in a situation like this, we have the strange phenomenon that it may be in the interests of some Conservative voters to put Labour as their first preference in order to gain a substantial block of Liberal Democrat second-choice votes.</p>
<p>However, there are some pretty serious problems with actually voting tactically in this situation. Obviously if all Conservative voters were to do so it would be a disaster for the Conservatives. And you can&#8217;t coordinate your votes. So how do you decide what you, an individual Conservative voter, should do? If you are a mathematician, then you will probably toss a coin a few times and make a probabilistic decision, but something tells me that that practice is unlikely to catch on. And of course, it is ridiculous to suppose that you will know what proportion of Lib Dem voters are likely to put the Conservatives as their second choice. </p>
<p>To get an idea of just how much less tactical voting there would be under AV, try to imagine a slogan as punchy as &#8220;A vote for the Liberals is a wasted vote.&#8221; You won&#8217;t get very far with &#8220;A vote for the Conservatives might let in the Lib Dems with the help of Labour second preferences, whereas a vote for Labour will help the Conservatives win with the help of Lib Dem second preferences, but could only a few people pay attention to this please?&#8221; In practice, hardly anyone will have a good reason to do anything other than put in order of preference the parties that they have a view about.</p>
<p><strong>Is the First Past The Post system the First Past The Post system?</strong></p>
<p>This is another question that seems to have a trivial answer but actually doesn&#8217;t. Presumably First Past The Post is a metaphor. Indeed, it <em>is</em> a metaphor &#8212; from horse racing. So let us try to work out how the metaphor works. Presumably there should be a post somewhere. So what is the post? Hmm &#8230; it&#8217;s hard to say. </p>
<p>A natural answer might be that you pass the post when your party reaches 50%. That is, you would have a sort of race, and the first party to get over 50% would be declared the winner. Are there any systems like that? Oh yes, AV. (And not just AV, but that is the one we have the chance to choose.) </p>
<p>For the most part I want to stick to rational argument, but sometimes it&#8217;s quicker and more effective to use slogans. Here&#8217;s one I like: </p>
<p>FIRST PAST THE POST IS NOT FIRST PAST THE POST!</p>
<p>And to those who think it is, how about</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE POST?</p>
<p>(Under some circumstances, the first word might perhaps be replaced by &#8220;wtf&#8221;, but not on this nice family blog.)</p>
<p><strong>If I want to vote selfishly, then how should I vote?</strong></p>
<p>Suppose that you firmly support one political party and your only interest is to do what will best serve that party, ignoring all questions of fairness, democratic principle, etc. How should you vote in the referendum? </p>
<p>If you support the Conservatives, then probably you should vote no. It was the FPTP system that allowed Mrs Thatcher to rule for eleven years with large majorities and well under half the votes. It is possible that the Liberal Democrats are so damaged by the current coalition that we will see a return to straight two-party politics for a while (in which case whether we have FPTP or AV will not make much difference to the outcomes of elections). But unless the political landscape really has permanently changed, FPTP gives the Conservatives the best chance of exploiting the split on the left, whereas AV allows those of a broadly left-wing persuasion to vote in an anything-but-Tory way.</p>
<p>If you support the Liberal Democrats then it&#8217;s a no-brainer.</p>
<p>If you support Labour, then it is less clear what you should do. Perhaps you will look back at the three elections won by Tony Blair, and at the current unpopularity of the coalition, and think that you don&#8217;t need the help of AV. But if that is your view, then I suggest you look back further to the dark days of the 1980s. Under AV there is a real chance that Labour would have won the 1983 election, or at least been able to form a grand coalition with the Alliance, and the same goes for the subsequent elections: it is unlikely that John Major would have had his shock victory in 1992, for instance. And AV would not have <em>stopped</em> Blair from winning his resounding victories. Probably in 2005 it would have left Blair a little more punished for the Iraq war, but probably you wouldn&#8217;t regard that as a defect of AV. And as for the future, when the Conservatives reduce the number of seats you will have a lot of electoral ground to make up. If the Lib Dem vote collapses then AV won&#8217;t harm you, and if it doesn&#8217;t collapse then AV will make it much more likely that you will be in a position to defeat the Tories. </p>
<p>To put it in slogan form again,</p>
<p>A LABOUR SUPPORTER VOTING FOR FPTP IS A TURKEY VOTING FOR CHRISTMAS.</p>
<p>Or to be more visual about it,<br />
<img src="http://www.yestofairervotes.org/page/-/uploads/turkey320.jpg/@mx_600" alt="Turkey voting for Christmas" /></p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said above, it&#8217;s a little more complicated than that, but the whole point of slogans is to ignore all those little qualifications.</p>
<p><strong>Some claims by the NO2AV campaign.</strong></p>
<p>I would like to assess some of the claims about AV that have been made by those campaigning against it.</p>
<p>1. <em>Under AV the person who comes second or third can win.</em></p>
<p>I find this argument laughable. The truth that the above sentence expresses is that under AV the person who <em>would have come first under FPTP</em> will not always win. Well I&#8217;ll be: it turns out that AV and FPTP do not lead to identical results. So <em>that</em> is why we are having a referendum. Duh.</p>
<p>This objection to AV is so blatantly question-begging that it is quite extraordinary that anyone can seriously advance it as an argument. The NO2AV campaign has a TV advertisement involving a horse race. At the end of the race, to everyone&#8217;s bemusement, the horse that comes in third is deemed to have won. This is supposed to be an argument against AV.</p>
<p>If I had the resources, I would make a counter-advertisement. It would go something like this. There is a mile-long horse race. As the horses approach 4/5 of a mile, Tory Boy is in the lead, but Labour Lad is storming up from behind and clearly about to overtake. Meanwhile Demon Libby is flagging badly and may not finish. </p>
<p>Suddenly the race stewards run on to the track and stop the race. To general bemusement, Tory Boy is declared the winner, despite the fact that the race was not yet over and Labour Lad clearly had more in the tank for the vital closing stages.</p>
<p>Final slogan: UNDER FIRST PAST THE POST, YOU DON&#8217;T HAVE TO BE FIRST PAST THE POST!</p>
<p>2. <em>AV is unfair/undemocratic.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t actually know what the NO2AV campaigners mean here. But I think they again mean that AV yields results that are different from the results of FPTP. The extreme unfairness of relatively large third parties getting a negligible share of the seats under FPTP does not figure in their calculations.</p>
<p>The idea that AV is less democratic than FPTP makes even less sense to me. AV allows people to express their <em>actual</em> political preferences rather than being forced (if they don&#8217;t want to waste their vote) to vote tactically.</p>
<p>I suspect that the NO2AV campaigners would rather not specify what they mean by calling AV unfair and undemocratic, since that way their arguments cannot be properly scrutinized. However, it may be that in the back of their minds is another objection that has been made several times, which is the following.</p>
<p>3. <em>Under AV, some people get more votes than others.</em></p>
<p>The beauty of this objection (from the point of view of its political effectiveness, by which I mean its ability to persuade people who don&#8217;t feel like thinking critically) is that it cleverly confuses a true statement with a false statement. It would be ludicrously unfair if some people were given more ballot papers to fill in than others. But that, it hardly needs pointing out, is not what happens. What <em>does</em> happen is that some people&#8217;s second (or lower) preferences are taken into account and other people&#8217;s are not.</p>
<p>This is presented as an unfair advantage to those whose lower preferences are taken into account. A hypothetical example sometimes given by the NO2AV campaign is of a BNP supporter getting five bites of the cherry whereas decent Conservative and Labour supporters get only one. (The British National Party is our lunatic far-right party. A typical quote from its manifesto: &#8220;At current immigration and birth rates, indigenous British people are set to become a minority well within 50 years. This will result in the extinction of the British people, culture, heritage and identity.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Is there any significant sense in which AV gives more votes to the BNP? There are various ways of thinking about this question, and none of them is of much comfort to BNP supporters.</p>
<p>Consider first what it means if you get five bites of the cherry. It means that your first-choice party is eliminated, and your second-choice party, and your third-choice party, and your fourth-choice party. Compare that with the poor old voter who gets just one bite of the cherry. Their party is either the party that wins or the party that comes second. In the first case, they obviously do better by far. In the second case, it is not clear: if you vote Labour and Labour come second to the Conservatives, then you might well have preferred the Liberal Democrats or the Greens. But (i) they were behind Labour and (ii) right until the final round your vote was counting for your favourite party rather than for lower and lower choices.</p>
<p>A quick slogan:</p>
<p>GETTING MORE BITES OF THE CHERRY IS A <em>DIS</em>ADVANTAGE STUPID!</p>
<p>The idea that it is unfair for some people to have their vote counted more often than others is &#8212; in so far as it means anything at all &#8212; just plain wrong. The NO2AV campaigners are saying that supporters of unpopular parties get more votes. What they actually get is more opportunities to <em>change</em> their vote. Since each change is from a higher preference to a lower preference, changing one&#8217;s vote is not something one wants to do. Simple isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Here is another way of thinking about this bizarre objection to AV. Let us contrast it with a different system that is manifestly fair. I&#8217;ll call it MR for Multiple Rounds. Under this system, everybody votes for just one candidate. If no candidate gets over 50%, then the least popular candidate is eliminated and there is a new round. Again, if no candidate gets over 50%, then the least popular candidate is eliminated and there is a new round. This process continues until a candidate does get over 50%.</p>
<p>This time, everybody gets one vote per round. How does that differ from AV? The answer is that under MR you have more flexibility in how you vote, for two reasons. The first reason is that if you put a party as your first choice in one round, you can put a different party as your first choice in a later round, even if the first party is still in the running. Secondly, you can allow your votes in later rounds to depend on the results of earlier rounds, which increases the opportunities to vote tactically. </p>
<p>Why might you want to change your first preference if the party you voted for is still in the running? I can think of a few reasons. One is that you might want to vote tactically because of something like the scenario I outlined earlier that can occur under AV: you want to eliminate a party so that the party you actually like can pick up votes from the supporters of that party. Another is that you like backing a winner, and you sense that a candidate has &#8220;momentum&#8221;. The first reason is a legitimate one but an undesirable feature of MR (so it is good that AV lacks it). The second is not, I think, rational in a vote for an MP, though it might be rational if you are voting for a party leader and want a display of unity.</p>
<p>So AV is effectively MR under two restrictions: you are not allowed to change your vote from round to round unless the party you are currently supporting is eliminated; and you are not allowed to know anything about the votes cast in previous rounds except which parties have been eliminated. Given those restrictions, you might as well just list your preferences in advance, and if you do then you&#8217;ve got AV. </p>
<p>A quick slogan:</p>
<p>AV IS MULTIPLE-ROUND VOTING MINUS TACTICAL GAME PLAYING.</p>
<p>If you think about AV that way, then you can see easily that no voter has an unfair advantage over any other voter &#8212; and supporters of unpopular parties are the worst off.</p>
<p>4. <em>AV is unfair because the least popular party gets its second-choice votes counted first.</em></p>
<p>Oh dear. There was even an article published in the Guardian that made this completely wrong point. If you buy the equivalence of AV and MR with restrictions, then you have an instant proof that the objection is wrong: under MR with restrictions, the least popular party does <em>not</em> get its second-choice votes counted first and yet the result is precisely the same.</p>
<p>Here is a different argument. Suppose there is a constituency with four candidates, representing Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, and the British National Party. The first preferences are</p>
<p>Labour, A<br />
Conservative, B<br />
Lib Dems, C<br />
BNP, D</p>
<p>where <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2BB%2BC%2BD%3D100&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='A+B+C+D=100' title='A+B+C+D=100' class='latex' /> and (let us suppose) <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%3EB%3EC%3ED.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D.' title='A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D.' class='latex' /></p>
<p>Those lucky BNP supporters now get their second-choice votes counted. Let&#8217;s suppose that <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%3DE%2BF%2BG&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='D=E+F+G' title='D=E+F+G' class='latex' /> and that <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='E,' title='E,' class='latex' /> <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='F' title='F' class='latex' /> and <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='G' title='G' class='latex' /> are the percentages of votes transferred to Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems, respectively. So after the first elimination the position is</p>
<p>Labour, A+E<br />
Conservatives, B+F<br />
Lib Dems, C+G</p>
<p>Suppose now that the Lib Dems are third. Now we have <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%3DH%2BJ&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='C=H+J' title='C=H+J' class='latex' /> and <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%3DK%2BL&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='G=K+L' title='G=K+L' class='latex' /> and the standings are</p>
<p>Labour A+E+H+K<br />
Conservatives B+F+J+L</p>
<p>Let us think carefully what <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%2C+J%2C+K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='H, J, K' title='H, J, K' class='latex' /> and <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='L' title='L' class='latex' /> stand for. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='H' title='H' class='latex' /> is the number (expressed as a percentage of the total number of voters) of Lib Dem voters who transfer to Labour, which means Lib Dems who either put Labour as their second choice or put the BNP as their second choice and Labour as their third choice. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='J' title='J' class='latex' /> is the same thing but with &#8220;the Conservatives&#8221; replacing &#8220;Labour&#8221;. <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='K' title='K' class='latex' /> is the number of BNP supporters who put the Lib Dems second and Labour third, and <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0' alt='L' title='L' class='latex' /> is the number of BNP supporters who put the Lib Dems second and the Conservatives third.</p>
<p>To see that this is exactly symmetrical between the BNP and the Lib Dems, let us see how the Conservative vote now breaks down. The votes they have are from</p>
<p>(i) people who put the Conservatives as their first choice,<br />
(ii) people who put the BNP as their first choice and the Conservatives as their second choice,<br />
(iii) people who put the BNP as their first choice, the Lib Dems as their second choice and the Conservatives as their third choice,<br />
(iv) people who put the Lib Dems as their first choice and the Conservatives as their second choice,<br />
(v) people who put the Lib Dems as their first choice, the BNP as their second choice and the Conservatives as their third choice.</p>
<p>Notice that the situation is entirely symmetrical between the BNP and the Lib Dems. The fact that the BNP second preferences are counted first is just a procedural convenience that does not affect the outcome. It does not give the BNP more power than the Lib Dems.</p>
<p>Here is a third, more concise, way of making the point. In the rounds where the BNP supposedly has an advantage over the Liberal Democrats, the BNP has been eliminated. So the BNP has lost and they have to make do with their second choices, while the Lib Dems are still in with a chance and can still have their first choices counted. In which position would you rather be?</p>
<p>5. <em>AV helps the BNP.</em></p>
<p>If that is the case, then it is odd that the BNP is against AV. But it is also odd that about half the Labour party is against AV, so perhaps the BNP is just being stupid (a possibility that, in the light of other evidence, cannot be discounted).</p>
<p>I have just explained why being eliminated first does not give you any advantage under AV, even over the party that is eliminated second. But perhaps it is nevertheless the case that your average BNP supporter is better off under AV, merely by virtue of being able to express a second preference at all. Under the current system, a BNP supporter has two options that are not completely daft. The first is the obvious one of voting BNP. (When I say that that is not completely daft, I mean that it is not daft if one&#8217;s object is to help the BNP. That object itself is of course completely daft.) The second is to buy the wasted-votes argument and choose the most racist party one can find that has a decent chance of being elected. The Conservatives tend to be tougher on immigration than Labour or the Lib Dems, so they will probably be the one to choose.</p>
<p>Under AV, this BNP supporter will no longer have a dilemma: it will be possible to vote BNP first, then UKIP (probably number two in the racism stakes), then Conservative, then Labour, and finally the Lib Dems.</p>
<p>This sounds like a big disadvantage of AV: it gives people a chance to vote BNP without wasting their vote.</p>
<p>Here are two counterarguments. The first is that it is not just BNP supporters who benefit in this way: <em>all</em> voters are freed from the shackles of the wasted-votes argument. If you are a Conservative supporter in a constituency where the Conservatives came third last time, you don&#8217;t have to agonize about whether to vote Conservative and risk letting in Labour: you can vote Conservative first and Lib Dem second, for instance. And the vast majority of the country who detest the BNP can express their dislike more forcefully by showing not just that the BNP is not their favourite party but that it is their least favourite party. To argue for FPTP on the grounds that AV helps the BNP by letting them express their preference for the Conservatives over Labour is to suggest that all voters should be punished for the sins of a tiny minority. </p>
<p>Slogan time.</p>
<p>WE SHOULD NOT LET THE BNP DICTATE HOW WE RUN OUR POLITICS.</p>
<p>A related point is this. Under AV the larger parties will know that once the BNP is eliminated, the second choices of BNP voters will count every bit as much as the first preferences of other voters. Since the BNP will, with probability 1, be eliminated, it would appear that there is now more reason to court the BNP vote than there was under FPTP. So AV could lead to parties adopting more unpleasant racist policies than FPTP does.</p>
<p>This argument sounds plausible but doesn&#8217;t stand up to scrutiny. First of all, it is simply untrue to say that FPTP gives a party no reason to court the racist vote. After all, under FPTP those racist voters are still out there, and they still might decide not to vote BNP (either because it is a wasted vote, or because they are embarrassed to vote for a party that is explicitly racist rather than dressing up their racism as concern for ordinary hard-working British families). And we do see, at every election under FPTP, parties talking tough on immigration in an unpleasant way &#8212; or being punished for not doing so. </p>
<p>One further point is that in most constituencies the BNP are a smaller party than the Lib Dems or the Greens or UKIP. So they will be contributing far fewer of those precious second-choice votes. Therefore, courting the BNP (which in any case is politically hard to do explicitly) is not a sensible strategy, since for each BNP supporter that you attract, there will probably be ten Lib Dems that you alienate. </p>
<p>6. <em>AV is expensive.</em></p>
<p>Here is how the NO2AV campaign breaks down the cost of AV.</p>
<p>The referendum itself: £91 million.<br />
Electronic vote counting machines: £130 million.<br />
Explaining AV to voters: £26 million.</p>
<p>This adds up to £250 million (or rather, they say it does &#8212; actually it adds up to £247 million). We can take that straight down to £156 million with the help of the following simple observation:</p>
<p>THE REFERENDUM IS HAPPENING ANYWAY! DUH.</p>
<p>Just to make that point clear, imagine that a group of friends want to go to the cinema. Some people want to see Avatar, which is the film showing in a single-screen cinema just round the corner. But others are not so sure, so they suggest catching a bus to a large multiplex cinema where there are three films that look promising, one of which is Avatar. This plan is agreed upon, and when they are at the multiplex a discussion ensues about which film to watch. The Avatar supporters argue that the cost of the bus fare is an argument against choosing another film, since it would have been possible to watch Avatar without a bus journey. The rest of the group laugh in their faces. </p>
<p>£156 million is still a lot of money. Luckily we can take it down further: it is a straightforward lie that AV requires electronic vote-counting machines. That gets us down to £26 million.</p>
<p>Does it take that much money to explain AV to voters? If so, could I please please be the one who is paid £26 million to say &#8220;Put the candidates in order of preference until you don&#8217;t care any more&#8221;? Obviously, to explain how these preferences will affect the outcome is more difficult, but it is also not necessary, since following the simple instruction to put the candidates in order of preference is the right and rational thing to do (given that there will tend not to be enough information to make tactical voting a practical possibility). </p>
<p>But for those who think it&#8217;s necessary, here&#8217;s another slogan.</p>
<p>AV IS EXPLAINED ON THE INTERNET.</p>
<p>7. <em>AV is complicated/obscure/perverse.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just dealt with this objection. My basic answer to it is, &#8220;No it isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me repeat how to vote under AV:</p>
<p>PUT THE CANDIDATES IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE UNTIL YOU DON&#8217;T CARE ANY MORE.</p>
<p>That is not complicated, obscure or perverse.</p>
<p>In case you want to know how your vote will count:</p>
<p>THERE ARE MULTIPLE ROUNDS. AS SOON AS A CANDIDATE HAS AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY THAT CANDIDATE WINS. AFTER EACH ROUND THE LEAST POPULAR CANDIDATE IS ELIMINATED. IN EACH ROUND YOUR VOTE GOES TO YOUR TOP PREFERENCE AMONGST THE CANDIDATES STILL IN PLAY.</p>
<p>That takes a bit longer to explain, but it is still pretty simple. Simple enough, for example, for leadership elections in the main political parties. And if, despite that, you don&#8217;t understand it, it doesn&#8217;t matter, since it is still in your interests to put the candidates in order of preference. (An analogy: your computer is very useful to you even if you don&#8217;t understand in detail how it works. And if you did understand how it worked, it wouldn&#8217;t affect how you surf the internet, send emails, etc.)</p>
<p>8. <em>AV leads to the election of mediocre candidates.</em></p>
<p>The argument here is that under AV you often end up electing the candidate who is least disliked rather than the candidate who is most liked. This is supposedly a recipe for mediocrity.</p>
<p>Let us set aside the obvious point that mediocre people do not seem to be blocked from the House of Commons by FPTP. It might still be the case that <em>more</em> mediocre people would get in under AV. But would they?</p>
<p>Let us consider a typical case where AV and FPTP lead to different results. Suppose that there is a constituency with a solid 40% support for the Conservatives and a split of the left vote between Labour and the Liberal Democrats (with Labour getting 35% and the Lib Dems 25%, say). If the Lib Dems tend to prefer Labour to the Conservatives, then Labour will probably win this seat under AV, while the Conservatives would win it under FPTP. </p>
<p>The question we are now considering is this: would the Labour candidate be likely to be more mediocre than the Conservative candidate? If you are sufficiently right wing, then perhaps you will think that the answer is yes merely because the Labour candidate is a Labour candidate. But in that case you are not thinking about the merits of AV in the abstract but merely about whether it helps your party. And I&#8217;ve already made the point that AV probably wouldn&#8217;t help the Conservatives, which is why they are campaigning vigorously against it.</p>
<p>Does it favour mediocre candidates (or parties) if second preferences have a significant effect on the vote? Let us try to imagine how AV would affect an election campaign in the hypothetical constituency just discussed. Under FPTP the Conservatives could afford to reach out to their core support and be pretty confident of winning the seat. But under AV they would know that that was not enough: they would need to attract at least two fifths of the Lib Dem voters. Similarly, Labour would know that they needed to attract at least three fifths of Lib Dem voters. </p>
<p>Since the Lib Dems are somewhere in the centre, it would probably be a bad idea to push for extreme right or extreme left policies. So in this constituency, the need for the two largest parties to attract the second preferences of Lib Dems would act as a curb on extremism. I&#8217;m not talking here about BNP-style extremism but just the sort of extremism-lite that you get on the right of the Conservative party and the left of the Labour party. Does that mean that candidates would become bland and mediocre? Well, it&#8217;s true that some of our more colourful politicians, people like Enoch Powell, Tony Benn, Dennis Skinner, Norman Tebbit, have been on the extreme wings of their parties. But some pretty notable politicians have come from the centre too, such as Kenneth Clarke, Tony Blair, David Owen, and many more. And AV isn&#8217;t going to get rid of those with extreme views since there will still be safe seats where they do not need to attract Lib Dems &#8212; it&#8217;s just that there won&#8217;t be as many of them.</p>
<p>To sum this up in a slogan:</p>
<p>FPTP HELPS EXTREMISTS.</p>
<p>In general, suppose we have a constituency where one candidate is liked by 40% of voters and loathed by 60%, while another candidate is liked by 35% of voters and quite liked by a further 20% of voters. Which candidate best represents the views of the constituents? There is a strong case for saying that it is the second. Certainly, if you were to ask the constituents which they preferred <em>just out of the leading two candidates</em> they would say the second.</p>
<p>In fact, I can feel a slogan coming on.</p>
<p>UNDER FPTP A CANDIDATE IS OFTEN ELECTED EVEN THOUGH MOST PEOPLE PREFER A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE.</p>
<p>9. <em>AV leads to more coalitions and hung parliaments.</em></p>
<p>In the UK there have been a number of coalitions and hung parliaments under FPTP, as well as periods where one party has been dominant. Would there have been more under AV? The evidence from other countries is inconclusive. I suspect that there might well have been a hung parliament in 1983 under AV, since the split on the left would no longer have given Margaret Thatcher her huge majority. But in general it is far from clear that AV has this effect: indeed, some have argued that AV leads to swings that are even larger than those under FPTP. As an example, consider the 1997 election. There the Conservatives were extremely unpopular but held on to 165 seats with the help of FPTP. I don&#8217;t know the figures, but probably they had outright majorities in many of those seats. However, there will also have been several seats where they won with less than 50% of the vote, and it seems likely that in many of those they would have lost out under AV, since Labour and Liberal Democrat voters would have been unlikely to put the Conservatives as their second choice. </p>
<p>There is also the question of whether, if AV leads to more coalitions (which is debatable), one should regard this as an advantage or a disadvantage. Such is the unpopularity of the present coalition that many people have now decided that they don&#8217;t like coalitions at all. But the alternative to coalitions is that representatives of a minority of the country have unfettered power to do what they like. It is not obviously better. </p>
<p>10. <em>AV benefits the Lib Dems and nobody else.</em></p>
<p>This is false. It benefits any party that is small but large enough to have a serious chance of getting seats. (I am not including the Scottish and Welsh Nationalists or the parties in Northern Ireland, because I count those as large parties in the areas that they represent.) The Greens are an example, and perhaps UKIP will be another. The Lib Dems are so unpopular now that at least for the time being it is unlikely that any voting system will help them. And if it ever does, we will be talking about an overhauled and rehabilitated Lib Dem party. And AV would in the past have helped Labour on a number of occasions, because they could have picked up Lib Dem (or Lib, or Alliance) second-choice votes.</p>
<p>11. <em>Voting AV will give a big boost to Nick Clegg.</em></p>
<p>Yes, if AV wins then it will put a big creepy smile on Nick Clegg&#8217;s face. So a slogan is needed again.</p>
<p>THIS REFERENDUM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH NICK CLEGG!</p>
<p>If you are planning to vote no to spite Nick Clegg, you should bear in mind the following points.</p>
<p>(i) The chance to change the voting system comes around very rarely because under FPTP the parties in power tend to have no interest in changing it, and hung parliaments, which give the Lib Dems a chance to negotiate, come around about once a generation.</p>
<p>(ii) You may hate the Liberal Democrats now, but think back to when you hated other parties. If you vote no to AV, then today&#8217;s Liberal Democrats will be very disappointed. But so will the Liberal Democrats of fifteen years time, who will be a completely different bunch of people, chastened by the experience of this coalition and certain to make keeping their pre-election promises their absolute top priority. Or perhaps they will have been annihilated completely and a different party, such as the Greens, will occupy the ground that they have traditionally occupied. </p>
<p>DON&#8217;T TAKE A LONG-TERM DECISION FOR SHORT-TERM REASONS!</p>
<p>(iii) Why do you hate Nick Clegg so much? Presumably because you hate the Conservatives, and Nick Clegg has allowed the Conservatives to govern with a minority. So it&#8217;s really the Conservatives you don&#8217;t want. And who has most to gain from retaining FPTP? The Conservatives. </p>
<p>Let me summarize:</p>
<p>NICK CLEGG IS TOAST ALREADY. VOTE YES TO SPITE DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE!</p>
<p>Let me summarize again:</p>
<p>DON&#8217;T BITE OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE!</p>
<p>12. <em>FPTP makes it easier to get rid of unpopular governments.</em></p>
<p>This is a clever argument that was put forward a couple of days ago by David Cameron. Once again, I mean clever from the political point of view: it sounds persuasive despite being wrong. In fact, it is better still, since it suggests a general technique that all politicians can use. If your party stands for X and Y is an adverse consequence of X, defend X on the grounds that not-Y is a consequence of X. For example, if, as all economists will tell you, spending cuts lead to increased unemployment, go out and say that you are making spending cuts in order to create jobs in the future. </p>
<p>The idea that FPTP has made it easy to get rid of unpopular governments is one that you can hold only if you wilfully ignore history. Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s government was deeply unpopular but proved to be extremely hard to dislodge. Blair was loathed after the Iraq war but went on to win another election, and his successor, Gordon Brown, though defeated in 2010, came close to having enough seats to form a viable coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Under AV it would have been much easier to get rid of Mrs Thatcher, for reasons I have already discussed: she would not have been able to exploit the split on the left. However, it is also worth saying that part of the reason that it was so hard to get rid of Thatcher and later Blair was that Labour in the 1980s and the Conservatives in the 2000s were going through periods of internal conflict and were not obviously electable. If you want to get rid of an unpopular government, it helps to have a viable opposition. </p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s worth having a look at the results of another election, the one that took place in 2005, not long after Blair&#8217;s decision to invade Iraq. A large number of people were furious with him for misleading them about weapons of mass destruction, with the result that his share of the vote dropped substantially. The results were</p>
<p>Labour, 35.2% of the vote, 355 seats</p>
<p>Conservatives, 32.4% of the vote, 198 seats</p>
<p>Liberal Democrats, 22.0% of the vote, 62 seats.</p>
<p>With barely over a third of the votes, Blair still had a comfortable majority in the House of Commons. It is difficult to reconcile this with the idea that FPTP makes it easy to get rid of unpopular governments. Under AV, the most likely result would (I am guessing) have been a hung parliament with Labour the largest single party. There is no chance that Charles Kennedy would have formed a coalition with the Conservatives, so we would probably not have got rid of Blair. But he would have been properly punished for Iraq by being forced to cooperate with the Lib Dems, who were the one strongly anti-Iraq-war party.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I think David Cameron might have meant by his statement. He thinks that AV leads to more coalitions, so he has a picture of an unpopular government managing to survive by forming a coalition with a smaller party. But how much of a danger is that? Nick Clegg was desperate, after the last election, not to be seen to be playing that role for Gordon Brown.</p>
<p>Another slogan:</p>
<p>AV MAKES IT EASIER TO GET RID OF UNPOPULAR GOVERNMENTS!</p>
<p>To explain why in the abstract: if a government is unpopular, under AV you can vote for anything-but-the-status-quo. The party in power cannot rely on its core support. FPTP allows unpopular governments to cling on with the support of a minority of voters.</p>
<p>13. <em>FPTP gives equal votes to everybody.</em></p>
<p>I have already explained why it is nonsense to suppose that AV gives &#8220;more&#8221; votes to supporters of unsuccessful parties. In <a href="http://gowers.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/is-the-british-voting-system-fair/">another post</a> I explained in detail why FPTP does <em>not</em> give equal votes to everybody. To put that slightly better, although everyone gets one vote, some votes count far more than others: if you are in a marginal constituency, you have a far bigger chance of influencing the result of the election, and if you are in a safe seat then the politicians can afford to ignore you (whichever side they are on). Under AV this would still be a problem, but there would be fewer safe seats so the problem would be reduced.</p>
<p>If you want this point in slogan form, here it is:</p>
<p>VOTE YES TO AV UNLESS YOU LIVE IN BASILDON!</p>
<p>14. <em>FPTP has served us well for over a century. </em></p>
<p>There are variants of this, such as that FPTP is a traditionally British institution, part of how we do things here, etc. FPTP has given us long periods of stable Conservative or Labour rule, supported by a minority of voters. It has also given us periods of instability, such as in the 1970s, the mid-1990s, and perhaps &#8212; we shall see &#8212; the 2010s. It has been manifestly unfair on a number of occasions. It has provided us with a strange cycle where, to oversimplify grotesquely, Labour spends too much of our money, which is lovely for a while but eventually gets the economy into a mess, then the Conservatives promise to sort out the mess but do so in a brutal way without much regard for the social consequences. (Because economic decisions tend to have effects only after quite a long time lag, we also have the phenomenon that a party&#8217;s reputation for economic competence depends a lot on the economic consequences of decisions made by its predecessors.) </p>
<p>Is FPTP serving us well? I don&#8217;t think so. If there were more of a need to court the centre (as there would be under AV, since Lib Dem second-choice votes would be more important), then perhaps, just perhaps, the boom/bust cycle could be stabilized. I don&#8217;t want to say that that would be an inevitable result of AV, since short-termism is always going to be very tempting for politicians, but with FPTP we can be pretty sure of getting more of the same (unless the current economic crisis is so severe that recovering from it takes decades rather than years). </p>
<p>If you are voting no because you regard FPTP as a Great British Tradition, then you might be interested in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/av/av-debate-the-voting-system-that-cameron-is-fighting-for-is-a-veritable-novelty-2270578.html">this article in the Independent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong></p>
<p>I realize that I have largely failed in my aim to adopt a neutral tone. However, that is because most of the arguments put forward by opponents to AV have been clearly wrong, in several cases so wrong that one can actually prove mathematically that they are wrong. I find it very dispiriting to live in a country where it can benefit a politician to use a provably incorrect argument. I have complained about this in other posts on this blog: a short, succinct, punchy statement that is wrong trumps a longer and ever so slightly complicated explanation of why it is wrong. That is why I have interspersed my longer explanations, which, if I were to make them in parliament would probably be met with derisory who-is-this-guy laughter, with shorter slogans. Perhaps you can think of some better ones. In my wildest dreams, I wonder whether some people might consider tweeting them. Could &#8220;WTF IS THE POST?&#8221; go viral? Well, probably not, but if it did then it would change more minds than dull and not obviously correct pro-AV slogans such as &#8220;Make your MP work harder.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t for a moment suppose that the power of incorrect arguments is a uniquely British phenomenon. I thank my lucky stars that we don&#8217;t (yet) have Fox News to contend with and that we don&#8217;t have to waste time explaining that Barack Hussein Obama is not a Muslim or that free universal healthcare in Britain doesn&#8217;t make us communists. (Unfortunately in Britain we do have to waste time, and probably trillions of pounds of our grandchildren&#8217;s money, explaining that there is an overwhelming consensus amongst people who know what they are talking about that man-made global warming is a serious problem. But the opposition to this view is more virulent in the USA.)</p>
<p>OK, rant over. I&#8217;ve wasted hours of precious work time on this, but I think it is a lost cause and need to get back to some mathematics.</p>

        <p>Catherine Rampell <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/rich-people-still-dont-realize-theyre-rich/">highlights</a> this stunning <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/147152/Americans-Split-Whether-Taxes-High.aspx">Gallup Poll</a> result:</p>

<blockquote>6 percent of Americans in households earning over $250,000 a year think their taxes are "too low." Of that same group, 26 percent said their taxes were "about right," and a whopping 67 percent said their taxes were "too high."</blockquote>

<p>OK, fine.  Most people don't like taxes.  No surprise there.  But get this next part:</p>

<blockquote>And yet when this same group of high earners was asked whether "upper-income people" paid their fair share in taxes, 30 percent said "upper-income people" paid too little, 30 percent said it was a "fair share," and 38 percent said it was too much.</blockquote>

<p>30 percent of these upper-income people say that upper-income people pay too little, but only 6 percent say that <em>they personally</em> pay too little.  38% say that upper-income people pay too much, but 67% say <em>they personally</em> pay too much.</p>
        <p>Rampell attributes this to people's ignorance about population statistics--these 250K+ families just don't realize that they're "upper income."  Another possible explanation is that most upper-income people feel that <em>other</em> upper-income people should pay more--perhaps these surveys have an idea that they don't cheat on their taxes but lots of others in their income bracket too.</p>

<p>I think Rampell's explanation is correct, though.  There's lots of evidence that people don't have a good feeling for population statistics--one of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2005/06/misperception_o.html">my favorite examples</a> is a Washington Post survey from 1995 that found that "Most whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asian Americans said the black population, which is about 12 percent, was twice that size." They similarly way overestimated the percentage of Hispanics and Asians in the country.  Whites overestimated the proportion of minorities, and minorities overestimated the proportion of minorities too.  Given that people haven't even learned these simple percentages, it's not shocking that they can't come to grips with something more complicated such as an income distribution.</p>

<p>As a statistician, I'm upset when people are so clueless about numbers that affect them personally, but as a social scientist, I recognize that this is just the way things are.  Most people aren't quantitatively minded.</p>

<p>P.S.  Some of Rampell's commenters said that they made about $250,000 but didn't feel that they were rich because they lived in expensive places like New York City.  So, just to calibrate . . . the <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/Unemployment/RDList2.asp?st=NY">median household income in Manhattan</a> in 2009 was $68000.  It may very well be true that Rampell's commenters aren't rich--but they are definitely "upper income," which is what the survey asked.</p>

<p>The headline to Rampell's article used the word "rich" which I've changed to "upper-income" to be more consistent with the survey question.  Also, the word "rich" seemed to freak out many of her commenters who started going off on rants without seeming to grasp her key point.</p>

<p>To put it another way, if you and your spouse make $125,000 each and you don't feel rich, than that's fine.  Rampell isn't saying you're a bad person.  She's just saying going with the statistics and pointing out that you're "upper income."  Her headline was a distraction.</p>

<p>P.P.S.  This discussion also relates in some convoluted way to my point #6 <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2011/04/american_belief.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The action exposes the lie that the US government does not control the Internet or does not exercise that control and perhaps hastens the day of a fragmented Internet.

To the hundreds of thousands who spoke out against the latter, kudos, but I submit that the former presents just as dangerous a slippery slope.</p>
<p>These companies are obeying the laws of the countries in which they are based. Who are we to block them let alone seize their Internet property?</p>

The MBA reports: <a href="http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/76346.htm">Mortgage Applications Increase in Latest MBA Weekly Survey</a><br />
<blockquote>The Refinance Index increased 2.7 percent from the previous week. The seasonally adjusted Purchase Index increased 10.0 percent to its highest level since December 3, 2010, driven largely by a 17.6 percent increase in Government purchase applications. <br />
...<br />
“Purchase application volume jumped last week largely due to another sharp increase in applications for government loans. Borrowers were likely motivated to apply for loans before the scheduled increase in FHA insurance premiums,” said Michael Fratantoni, MBA’s Vice President of Research and Economics. “Refinance activity increased somewhat, as rates dropped to their lowest level in a month towards the end of the week.”<br />
...<br />
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased to 4.83 percent from 4.98 percent, with points increasing to 1.07 from 0.93 (including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value (LTV) ratio loans. </blockquote><a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Existing-Home#category=Existing-Home&amp;chart=MBAApr202011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1200,height=850,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="MBA Purchase Index" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TYHMswQOQ2g/Ta7DzUfRyGI/AAAAAAAAKKc/qdp-sh1_gyQ/s320/MBAApr202011.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> <i><b><span style="font-size: small;">Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.</span></b></i><br />

What have they purchased lately? Are there opportunities to up-sell and cross-sell to them? You and everyone else in your organization want to know everything possible about your customers. You want a <em>single view of the customer</em> that everyone across the enterprise can use.</p>
<p>There’s nothing new about this. Businesses have been trying to get a single view of their customers and prospects for years.</p>
<p>With the goal of a single view in mind, software vendors initially developed customer oriented applications such as call center, campaign management and sales force automation (SFA) applications. Later, these vendors attempted to merge all customer-centric applications under the customer relationship management (CRM) umbrella.</p>
<p>The big idea was that the CRM software would provide a single view of the customer. &#0160;It didn’t quite turn out that way, however. Businesses bought these applications from various vendors but also custom-built their own applications, resulting in scattered customer data across many application silos. The result: <em>many</em> views of the customer.</p>
<p>Nowadays the new application that people hope will straighten out their customer data is customer data integration. Customer data integration combines the technology, processes and services you need to create and maintain customer information from all available sources, including contact details, <a href="http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid11_gci552684,00.html">customer valuation</a> data, and information gathered through interactions such as <a href="http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid11_gci942880,00.html">direct marketing</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no question that there’s s a huge benefit to integrating and managing a business’ customer data. After all, most businesses sell either products or services to customers. These customers can be businesses (B2B) or consumers (B2C).</p>
<p>Typically, a business will use campaign management and SFA software to identify prospects and acquire customers. Then it will use call center software to enable excellent support to retain these customers. But it doesn’t stop there. The business also wants to know what its customers have bought from them and then try to up-sell and cross-sell additional products or services.</p>
<p>It is clear that <em>data</em> is both the key inhibitor and enabler to accomplish this.</p>
<p>Without integrated and well managed customer data, businesses will either not be able to target appropriate customers or will spend too much money in doing so. The most effective customer acquisition, retention and up-sell campaigns are enabled by well integrated and managed customer data.</p>
<p>The large investments in these customer-centric applications over the years bears witness to the significant business benefits that a single view of the customer can deliver to an enterprise.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for next week’s post, in which I discuss separating the hype from the reality of customer data integration.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>My name is Mick Wagner and I worked by myself on this challenge in my free time.  I am fairly new to data mining but have been working in Business Intelligence the last 5 years.  I am a senior consultant in the Data Management and Business Intelligence practice at Logic20/20 in Seattle, WA.  My undergrad degree is in Industrial Engineering with an emphasis on Operations Research and Management Science out of Montana State University.   This is my second Kaggle competition I have entered.</p>
<p><span id="more-988"></span></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/stayalert">Stay Alert challenge</a> was sponsored by Ford to help prevent distracted drivers.  The objective of this challenge is to design a detector/classifier that will detect whether the driver is alert or not alert, employing any combination of vehicular, environmental and driver physiological data that are acquired while driving.</p>
<p>The data for this challenge shows the results of a number of &#8220;trials&#8221;, each one representing about 2 minutes of sequential data that are recorded every 100 ms during a driving session on the road or in a driving simulator.  The trials are samples from some 100 drivers of both genders, and of different ages and ethnic backgrounds.  The actual names and measurement units of the physiological, environmental and vehicular data were not disclosed in this challenge. Models which use fewer physiological variables are of particular interest; therefore competitors are encouraged to consider models which require fewer of these variables.</p>
<p><strong>Tools Used</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Excel</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server Stack (SQL Server Engine, SQL Server Integration Services, SQL Server Analysis Services)</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis</strong></p>
<p>I spent the majority of my time analyzing the data.  I inputted the data into Excel and started examining the data taking note of discrete and continuous values, category based parameters, and simple statistics (mean, median, variance, coefficient of variance).  I also looked for extreme outliers.</p>
<p>I read through the Kaggle discussion board to see if anything about the challenge had been changed or if Ford provided additional insight into the data.</p>
<p>The most important step I made was to take a step back and holistically examine the problem and the dataset.  The data was composed of various trials with different human experimenters.  My background in statistical quality control immediately told me that this would have a large impact on the statistical analysis and needed to be factored into the design of the system.  To do this, I created my own sets of test and training data.  Normally, Microsoft SQL Server randomly derives these sets based off of a HoldOutMaxPercent value that dictates the Test data size.  I made the first 150 trials (~30%) be my test data and the remainder be my training dataset (~70%).  This single factor had the largest impact on the accuracy of my final model.</p>
<p>My next breakthrough decision was limiting the copious amount of data that went into my algorithm.  I was concerned that using the entire data set would create too much noise and lead to inaccuracies in the model.  The final goal of the system is to detect the change in the driver from alert to not alert so that the car can self-correct or alert the driver.  So I decided to just focus on the data at the initial moment when the driver lost alertness.  This reduced my dataset significantly and I repeated my initial Excel analysis of the data.  I highlighted which factors consistently had a relatively large delta between status changes.</p>
<p><strong>Failed Attempts</strong></p>
<p>My first few attempts were running different types of models with the all the variables and Microsoft’s recommended variables.  I used a lift chart to compare their accuracy to each other.  My goal was to narrow down the possible algorithms given by Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services from seven down to 2.  Several models (Association Rules, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression) did not make sense to use because of the data types, structure of the data, and desired binary output.  The Decision Tree and Neural Network scored the highest on my lift chart.</p>
<p><strong>What Ended Up Working</strong></p>
<p>After testing the Decision Tree and Neural Network algorithms against each other and submitting models to Kaggle, I found the Neural Network model to be more accurate.</p>
<p>After initially trying the variables recommended by SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services), I augmented the solution with the variables I found key in my initial analysis.  These variables included: E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9, E10, P6, V4, V6, V10, and V11.</p>
<p>As recommended by Ford, I tried to avoid relying on physiological variables.  I did find P6 to be helpful though.</p>
<p>The key strengths of my model are ease to build, ease to deploy and maintain in an industry setting with transactional data, and scalability within SQL Server.  My model uses an out of the box algorithm that is well understood and respected.  It also took me significantly less attempts (and time) to scale to the top of the standings:</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> place: 24 entries</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> place (me): 8 entries</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup> place: 39 entries</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> place: 25 entries</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I mentioned, in a recent post, a <a href="http://opalesque.com/files/AlternativeEdge-Two_benchmarks_for_momentum_trading-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">paper by Newedge</a> presenting a Trend Follower CTA sub-Index as well as a <strong>mechanical Trend Following benchmark</strong> (Newedge Trend Indicator).</p>
<p>I recently found another paper taking the concept further: <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1279594" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fooling some of the People all of the time: The inefficient Performance and Persistence of CTAs</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
Investors face significant barriers in evaluating the performance of hedge funds and commodity trading advisors (CTAs). The only available performance data comes from voluntary reporting to private companies. Funds have incentives to strategically report to these companies, causing these data sets to be severely biased. And, because hedge funds use nonlinear, state-dependent, leveraged strategies, it has proven difficult to determine whether they add value relative to benchmarks. We focus on commodity trading advisors, a subset of hedge funds, and show that during the period 1994-2007 CTA excess returns to investors (i.e., net of fees) averaged 85 basis points per annum over US T-bills, which is insignificantly different from zero. We estimate that CTAs on average earned gross excess returns (i.e., before fees) of 5.4%, which implies that funds captured most of their performance through charging fees. Yet, even before fees we find that CTAs display no alpha relative to simple futures strategies that are in the public domain. We argue that CTAs appear to persist as an asset class despite their poor performance, because they face no market discipline based on credible information. Our evidence suggests that investors’ experience of poor performance is not common knowledge.</p></blockquote>
<p>The irony is in the timing of the report: it was published in<span id="more-4109"></span> Autumn 2008 &#8211; with one of its main authors from AIG Financial Products!<br />
The paper is quite academic, but simple empirical evidence from 2008 showed that:</p>
<ol>
<li>It might be wise to apply a healthy does of skepticism with regards to AIG financial engineering.</li>
<li>CTAs are able to produce extraordinary (and uncorrelated) returns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless&#8230;<br />
In its first part, the paper builds a &#8220;bias-free&#8221; index of CTAs to establish their collective risk and return performance &#8211; and &#8220;establishes&#8221; that CTAs do produce alpha (statistically significant above-T-bill returns) but capture most of it in their fees, making the net (of fees) returns insignificantly positive, relative to T-bills</p>
<p>The performance numbers used in the paper are all derived from the Lipper-TASS hedge fund database and the index building methodology considers the following biases, while not being able to correct all of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survivorship</strong>: all CTAs that have &#8220;died&#8221; are included in the index</li>
<li><strong>Backfill</strong>: &#8220;non-live&#8221;, historical reporting is not included in the index. CTAs can include past data when they start reporting to the database. These performance numbers are not included in the index.</li>
<li><strong>Selection</strong>: since CTA reporting is voluntary, some funds are not included in the database. These are likely to be bad-performing ones. Nearly impossible to correct for this bias.</li>
<li><strong>Look-back</strong>: some funds can request to have their track record history completely removed from the database</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second part, the paper presents some benchmarks developed using systematic trading strategies in equities, currencies and commodities (strangely, the trading model aims to reproduce a trend following strategy by considering the fundamental price-to-book ration for equities for instance&#8230;).</p>
<p>Comparing the CTA index performance to these models, the paper concludes that CTA performance is poor. However it does seem that the models built by the authors fail to represent CTA and trend following very well. In their own words: </p>
<blockquote><p>The finding [...] already suggests that CTAs follow strategies that are different from those embedded in the benchmarks.</p></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote><p>The predominant style has been one of trend-following, most pronounced in currencies, but the combined factors have a maximum explanatory power of 33% (over the period 2001-2007).</p></blockquote>
<p>In the last parts, the paper attempts to explain the persistence of CTAs, in the face of these &#8220;poor performances&#8221;.</p>
<p>Positive returns coupled with low to negative correlations to other asset classes (to improve portfolio performance as per <a href="http://www.automated-trading-system.com/eighteenth-century-trend-following-and-more-history/">Liz Cheval&#8217;s presentation</a> for example) would be on top of my list, but the paper only quickly &#8220;glosses over&#8221; the subject without giving it further investigation:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is less clear is whether this tail behavior (negative correlations) is sufficient to justify an investment in CTAs despite the poor performance. This would not seem to be justification since this type of diversification can be achieved at much lower cost using passive indices of commodity futures; see Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2006). The correlations of CTA returns with traditional asset classes in the tails seem unlikely to justify investors allocating $200 billion to an asset class that offers T-bill returns with a standard deviation that is comparable to equities.</p>
<p>We conclude that there is no compelling evidence to justify investing in CTAS in a portfolio context.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other areas covered are returns skewness and information asymmetry between investors and funds.</p>
<h3>Is the CTA Index Realistic?</h3>
<p>Given the low barrier to entry and high attrition rates highlighted by the report, I believe it would make sense to adjust for these factors &#8211; as would real-life investors/allocators, who are fully aware of these issues (this is probably the primary reason why it is very hard to sell a CTA to investors without a track record of any decent length).<br />
In order to &#8220;flush out&#8221; all the &#8220;bad CTAs&#8221; that fail after their first few years, the paper could mimic natural investor behaviour, and only include CTA track records after a minimum live reporting period. This would have been an interesting addition and represented more realistic investor&#8217;s expectations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the association &#8220;CTA = Trend Followers&#8221; established by the paper might be true for CTAs in activity, but who knows what percentage of failed CTAs actually used Trend Following as their main strategy. Maybe the database graveyard is littered with mean-reverters or other CTAs.</p>
<h3>Commoditization of Trend Following</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, the paper goes in the same direction as a few others, hinting at a possible &#8220;commoditization of Trend Following&#8221; (discussed last year in <a href="http://www.automated-trading-system.com/betafication-alpha-commoditization-trend-following/">this post</a> on the blog). I actually thought that the <a href="http://www.eurekahedge.com/news/attachments/06_feb_Conquest_The_Beta_of_Managed_Futures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beta of Managed Futures</a> from the Conquest Group provided a better illustration of the concept.</p>
<p>This is also a concept I have been able to verify on the blog by running the <a href="http://www.automated-trading-system.com/resources/state-trend-following/">State of Trend Following report</a> every month and by comparing its results to those of the <a href="http://www.automated-trading-system.com/resources/trend-following-wizards-fund-performance/">Trend Following Wizards</a>. I have not run any correlation calculations (note to self: add this on the to-do list) but the results of the report have usually been a good empirical predictor of the wizards monthly performance.</p>
<p>Since I wrote that &#8220;trend following commoditization&#8221; post, a new actively managed ETF based on Trend Following/Tactical Asset Allocation principles (<a href="http://www.automated-trading-system.com/gtaa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GTAA</a>) was launched by the guys at Cambria (i.e. Mebane Faber from <a href="http://www.mebanefaber.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">World Beta</a> blog).<br />
It is not directly comparable to a futures trend follower CTA as it only deals with ETFs, but its rapid success since launch (it raised over $150M since launch about 6 months ago) shows that there is a space for low expense/fee mechanical funds in the Trend Following area.</p>
<p>Whether these types of funds manage to perform on-par with (or outperform) CTAs on a net-of-fees basis will be interesting to follow. Another such fund, The Managed Futures Select (systematic CTA replication strategy, with low fees) from the Conquest Group claims to outperform CTAs. However, it depend which group of CTAs one looks at for comparison. On <a href="http://www.automated-trading-system.com/cta-alpha-calculate/">this other post</a> from last year, using a modified version of the Information Ratio to compare the respective performances of the Trend Following Wizards and the Conquest MFS fund, those CTAs still appeared to produce alpha over the &#8220;Index fund&#8221; (with the disclaimer that the Wizards group might include some selection/survivorship bias).</p>
<p>I concluded last year&#8217;s post with :</p>
<blockquote><p>When the launch of a Trend Following ETF?</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that this has happened, what is the next step in the commoditization of Trend Following?</p>

</ul><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So this is a healthy business, isn't it?</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Now, let's look at the impact of a twenty percent increase in loyalty.</div><ul style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><li>300,000 * (0.50*1.20) + 1,000,000 * (0.05*1.20) + 200,000 = 440,000 buyers.</li>
</ul><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Here's the problem.&nbsp; It's REALLY HARD to increase customer loyalty.&nbsp; If it were easy to bump retention rates by 20%, everybody would be doing it, and all of our businesses would be growing at unfettered rates, right?</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Try this one on for size.&nbsp; Grow new customers by 20%.</div><ul style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><li>300,000 * 0.50 + 1,000,000 * 0.05 + 200,000*1.20 = 440,000 buyers.</li>
</ul><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Improving customer loyalty requires fundamental shifts in marketing, merchandising, and service.&nbsp; It's terribly hard to improve customer loyalty.&nbsp; Go back and look at retention rates over the past decade, you'll quickly notice that retention rates barely move.</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Now go back and look at new customer acquisition counts over the past decade.&nbsp; You'll quickly notice that YOU decide new customer acquisition counts ... you make changes to your marketing budget, and you see an immediate cause-and-effect, don't you?</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />
</div><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">New customers matter.&nbsp; Best of all, you control your own destiny.&nbsp; So few loyalty initiatives push the peanut.&nbsp; So many new customer acquisition investments pay off over time.</span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/32202893-5041736380550917291?l=blog.minethatdata.com' alt='' /></div><div class="feedflare">

<blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">Hi Igor </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I have recently developed a general purpose Python module for CS recovery for both complex and real bases/signals. It is just a direct implementation of l1 minimization algorithm using the opensource package <a href="http://abel.ee.ucla.edu/cvxopt/">CVXOPT</a>. It is not a fast software, but can be used by CS learners or people who want to use l1-minimization within a scripting language like Python. It is also useful for people who cannot access MATLAB. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The code can be found on my homepage under Software section: </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.deeds.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/reza/index.html#software">http://www.deeds.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/reza/index.html#software </a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />

Thanks <a href="http://www.deeds.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/reza/index.html">Mohammadreza</a>! With regards to being fast, <a href="http://ee.sharif.ir/~SLzero/">SL0</a> might do the trick and it should be easily implementable in Python.<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">Since LASSO solvers are potentially becoming important with respect to <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/search/label/MultiplicativeNoise">their ability to deal with multiplicative noise</a> and since most of the literature on the subject is done in statistics, I drew this table of correspondence between terms and variable names generally used in Machine Learning/Statistics and Compressed Sensing so as to enable a faster reading of these papers.

Note: This index is a leading indicator for new Commercial Real Estate (CRE) investment. <br />
<br />
From Reuters: <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/20/usa-construction-abi-idUSN1912179420110420">US architecture billings index flat in March -AIA<br />
</a><br />
<blockquote>The Architecture Billings Index slipped 0.1 point to 50.5 in March, according to the American institute of Architects.<br />
...<br />
"Demand is not falling back into the negative territory, but also not exhibiting the same pace of increases seen at the end of 2010," said AIA Chief Economist Kermit Baker. </blockquote><a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?CRE#category=CRE&chart=ABIMar2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1070,height=755,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="AIA Architecture Billing Index" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1WYh6AImOew/Ta5TYKPBu5I/AAAAAAAAKKY/qrWYYU-BlWM/s320/ABIMar2011.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> <i><b><span style="font-size: 85%;">Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.</span></b></i><br />
<br />
This graph shows the Architecture Billings Index since 1996. The index showed billings increased slightly in March (index at 50.5, anything above indicates an increase in billings).<br />
<br />
Note: Nonresidential construction includes commercial and industrial facilities like hotels and office buildings, as well as schools, hospitals and other institutions.<br />
<br />
According to the AIA, there is an "approximate nine to twelve month lag time between architecture billings and construction spending" on non-residential construction. So this indicator suggests the drag from CRE investment will end mid-year 2011 or so - but there won't be a strong increase in investment.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Link to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculatedriskblog</a>!<img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10004977-3989311095430624038?l=www.calculatedriskblog.com' alt='' /></div></div>

Guibas</a>,  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Merigot_Q/0/1/0/all/0/1">Quentin Mérigot</a> (LJK),  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Morozov_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Dmitriy Morozov</a> (LBNL)</div><blockquote class="abstract">Distance function to a compact set plays a central role in several areas of computational geometry. Methods that rely on it are robust to the perturbations of the data by the Hausdorff noise, but fail in the presence of outliers. The recently introduced distance to a measure offers a solution by extending the distance function framework to reasoning about the geometry of probability measures, while maintaining theoretical guarantees about the quality of the inferred information. A combinatorial explosion hinders working with distance to a measure as an ordinary (power) distance function. In this paper, we analyze an approximation scheme that keeps the representation linear in the size of the input, while maintaining the guarantees on the inference quality close to those for the exact (but costly) representation. </blockquote><br />
<b>Notes</b>: <br />
The idea of defining distances between (or to) shapes robustly by replacing the shape by a distribution is near to my heart (see this paper for more). The authors provide an algorithmic perspective on a formulation first proposed by <a href="http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00383685_v2/">Chazal, Cohen-Steiner and Mérigot</a>. The idea is that instead of constructing a shape from a point cloud by growing balls of fixed radius and measuring the distance to this union of balls, one constructs a measure by growing balls out to a fixed measure, and then defining a distance. The distance measure has the nice property of being Lipschitz-related to the EMD, making it stable. In a manner reminiscient of the <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=142675.142747">Aurenhammer et al work</a>, they relate this distance to a power diagram construction, and then design efficient approximations for it (because the exact version involves terms exponential in the thresholding parameter).<br />
<br />
It seems to me that they're going to a lot of work to recover from what I think is a tactical problem: fixing a sharp threshold for the ball measure. It might be interesting to explore alternate ways of defining the measure that are "smoother" - maybe using a kernel instead of a hard measure boundary. It might yield an alternate measure that serves the same purpose but is easier to compute.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6555947-765408094688110758?l=geomblog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

<p>Mike Freedman gave a talk last week at Berkeley titled &#8220;(Still) thinking about the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare conjecture&#8221;, and I&#8217;d like to try and relate the main idea.</p>
<p>Back in 2009 Mike, Bob Gompf, Kevin Walker and I wrote <a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2009/06/29/man-and-machine-thinking-about-spc4">a paper</a> &#8220;Man and machine thinking about the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare conjecture&#8221;, in which we discussed various equivalent and stronger conjectures with more of a &#8220;three manifold flavour&#8221;, as well as proposing a way to show that certain potential counterexamples, the Cappell-Shaneson spheres, really were counterexamples, using Khovanov homology.</p>
<p>As it turned out, for the Cappell-Shaneson spheres that our computers could cope with Khovanov homology didn&#8217;t provide an obstruction. Shortly thereafter, Selman Akbulut posted a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0136">short paper</a> showing that a certain integer family of CS spheres (including the two examples we considered) were all in fact standard, and not long after that Bob Gompf killed off <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1914">some more</a>. In fact, there&#8217;s been a whole flurry of work on SPC4 recently: Nash proposing <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2981">some more counterexamples</a>, Akbulut <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2683">killing these off</a> too, Akbulut <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3137">proving</a> a very general class of 4-spheres are standard, along with <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5308">[1]</a>, <a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com//arxiv.org/abs/1011.6274">[2]</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5571">[3]</a>. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1601">a paper</a> on Property 2R by Gompf, Scharlemann and Thompson.</p>
<p>Even though recent progress means that there are far far fewer potential counterexamples to SPC4 available, Mike has come up with another idea for detecting counterexamples! Essentially, from each proposed counterexample to the Andrews-Curtis conjecture (below), one can produce a homotopy 4-spheres. This part of the story is old news, but I&#8217;ll go over it carefully below. Mike points out that this construction also provides a family of embedded homology 3-spheres. Now any 3-manifold embeds in <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='S^5' title='S^5' class='latex' />, but not every 3-manifold embeds in <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='S^4' title='S^4' class='latex' /> (e.g. lens spaces, but see more below). The hope now is to show that one of these homology 3-spheres can not embed in the standard <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='S^4' title='S^4' class='latex' />, and thus that the homotopy 4-sphere it sits in must be exotic. Mike gave a condition on a 3-manifold Y that exactly determines whether it embeds in <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='S^4' title='S^4' class='latex' />, and talked about his ideas towards making this condition an effective test.</p>
<p>So, what is the Andrews-Curtis conjecture? A balanced presentation of a group is simply a presentation with equal numbers of generators and relations. The Andrews-Curtis moves on a balanced presentation are</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;1-handle slides&#8221;: replace a pair of generators <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7Bx%2C+y%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;{x, y&#92;}' title='&#92;{x, y&#92;}' class='latex' /> by <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7Bx%2C+xy%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;{x, xy&#92;}' title='&#92;{x, xy&#92;}' class='latex' />.</li>
<li>&#8220;2-handle slides&#8221;: replace a pair of relations <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7Br%2C+s%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;{r, s&#92;}' title='&#92;{r, s&#92;}' class='latex' /> by <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7Bg+r+g%5E%7B-1%7D+s%2C+s%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;{g r g^{-1} s, s&#92;}' title='&#92;{g r g^{-1} s, s&#92;}' class='latex' /> (here <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='g' title='g' class='latex' /> is any word in the generators).</li>
<li>&#8220;handle cancellation&#8221;: add a generator along with a new relation killing it</li>
</ul>
<p>The Andrews-Curtis conjecture says that any balanced presentation of the trivial group can be transformed by Andrews-Curtis moves to the trivial presentation. (There&#8217;s a stronger version that says handle cancellation isn&#8217;t even needed.) Despite the name, it&#8217;s widely expected to be false.</p>
<p>Before continuing, I should explain the funny names I&#8217;ve given the moves. Given any presentation of a group, we can build a two-complex whose fundamental group is the group: just take some 1-handles for the generators, and attach 2-handles killing the relations. The names I&#8217;ve given the moves correspond to the appropriate geometric operations on this 2-complex.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the presentation <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=xyx%3Dyxy%2C+x%5E5+%3D+y%5E4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='xyx=yxy, x^5 = y^4' title='xyx=yxy, x^5 = y^4' class='latex' />. It&#8217;s easy to check that this is the trivial group: <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E%7B-1%7Dy%5E%7B-1%7Dxyx&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='y = x^{-1}y^{-1}xyx' title='y = x^{-1}y^{-1}xyx' class='latex' />, so <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E5+%3D+x%5E%7B-1%7Dy%5E%7B-1%7Dx%5E5yx+%3D+x%5E%7B-1%7Dy%5E4x+%3D+x%5E5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='y^5 = x^{-1}y^{-1}x^5yx = x^{-1}y^4x = x^5' title='y^5 = x^{-1}y^{-1}x^5yx = x^{-1}y^4x = x^5' class='latex' />. Thus <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E5+%3D+y%5E4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='y^5 = y^4' title='y^5 = y^4' class='latex' />, and <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='y=1' title='y=1' class='latex' />. Even though that was easy, no one has found a sequence of Andrews-Curtis move, even after having looked extremely hard! (e.g. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2006.10128962">this paper</a>) This is just one case of the family <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B+xyx%3Dyxy%2C+x%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D+%3D+y%5En+%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;{ xyx=yxy, x^{n+1} = y^n &#92;}' title='&#92;{ xyx=yxy, x^{n+1} = y^n &#92;}' class='latex' /> of proposed counterexamples that appears in the <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=MR816520">paper</a> &#8220;A potential smooth counterexample in dimension 4 to the Poincaré conjecture, the Schoenflies conjecture, and the Andrews-Curtis conjecture&#8221;, by Selman Akbulut and Rob Kirby (Topology 24 (1985), 375&#8211;390). So far the Andrews-Curtis conjecture is just a problem in group theory, but the title of that paper should clue you in that we&#8217;re about to construct some manifolds!</p>
<p>Given a balanced presentation <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='P' title='P' class='latex' />, we can build a 5-manifold <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%28P%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='Q(P)' title='Q(P)' class='latex' />&#8212;just like we built the 2-complex above, start with a 5-ball, attach some 5-dimensional 1-handles for the generators, and then attach some 5-dimensional 2-handles for the relations. To attach the two handles, we actually need to pick links in the boundary of the 0- and 1-handles representing in <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;pi_1' title='&#92;pi_1' class='latex' /> the relation, but since these boundaries are 4-dimensional there are actually no choices to make. If we started with a presentation of the trivial group, then <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial+Q%28P%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;partial Q(P)' title='&#92;partial Q(P)' class='latex' /> is a homotopy 4-sphere. Moreover, if the presentation is a counterexample to the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, then perhaps this homotopy 4-sphere is a good candidate counterexample to SPC4: you can&#8217;t make it standard just by handle slides corresponding to some Andrews-Curtis moves! Of course, you have more freedom to simplify presentations of 4-manifolds, so just having a counterexample to AC doesn&#8217;t ensure a counterexample to SPC4.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Bob Gompf subsequently <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=MR1081936">showed</a> that <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial+Q%28xyx%3Dyxy%2C+x%5E5+%3D+y%5E4%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;partial Q(xyx=yxy, x^5 = y^4)' title='&#92;partial Q(xyx=yxy, x^5 = y^4)' class='latex' /> is in fact the standard 4-sphere (by introducing a cancelling pair of 2- and 3-handles!). Nevertheless all the higher values of n are still open.</p>
<p>We can alternatively build <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial+Q%28P%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;partial Q(P)' title='&#92;partial Q(P)' class='latex' /> in a different way. Start with a 4-ball, attached some 4-dimensional 1-handles for the generators, and now <strong>pick some links</strong> <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='L' title='L' class='latex' /> realizing the relations, and attach 4-dimensional 2-handles along these. This produces a 4-manifold <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28P%2CL%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='W(P,L)' title='W(P,L)' class='latex' />, which genuinely depends on <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='L' title='L' class='latex' />, but whose double (the boundary of <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W+%5Ctimes+I&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='W &#92;times I' title='W &#92;times I' class='latex' />) is just our homotopy 4-sphere <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial+Q%28P%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;partial Q(P)' title='&#92;partial Q(P)' class='latex' />. This way of building the homotopy 4-sphere gives us something extra; a 3-manifold <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%28P%2C+L%29+%3D+%5Cpartial+W%28P%2C+L%29+%5Ctimes+%5C%7B1%2F2%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='Y(P, L) = &#92;partial W(P, L) &#92;times &#92;{1/2&#92;}' title='Y(P, L) = &#92;partial W(P, L) &#92;times &#92;{1/2&#92;}' class='latex' /> sitting inside <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial+Q%28P%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;partial Q(P)' title='&#92;partial Q(P)' class='latex' />. In fact, this 3-manifold is a homology sphere.</p>
<p>The challenge now is to pick some counterexample to the AC conjecture, along with a corresponding link, and then to prove that the resulting homology sphere can not be embedded in the standard 4-sphere.</p>
<p>Now Mike wasn&#8217;t claiming he knew how to do this; but he did explain a relatively easy theorem giving a precise characterization of when a 3-manifold embeds in the standard 4-sphere, which has a very &#8220;3-manifold flavour&#8221;. This was</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> A 3-manifold <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='Y' title='Y' class='latex' /> embeds in <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='S^4' title='S^4' class='latex' /> if and only if it has an Heegaard diagram <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CSigma%2C+%5Calpha%2C+%5Cbeta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='(&#92;Sigma, &#92;alpha, &#92;beta)' title='(&#92;Sigma, &#92;alpha, &#92;beta)' class='latex' /> and an embedding <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ciota%3A+%5CSigma+%5Cto+R%5E3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;iota: &#92;Sigma &#92;to R^3' title='&#92;iota: &#92;Sigma &#92;to R^3' class='latex' />, such that <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ciota%28%5Calpha%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;iota(&#92;alpha)' title='&#92;iota(&#92;alpha)' class='latex' /> is an unlink, and <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ciota%28%5Cbeta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;iota(&#92;beta)' title='&#92;iota(&#92;beta)' class='latex' /> is an unlink.</p>
<p>Mike calls this a <em>doubly unlinked embedded Heegaard diagram</em>. The proof of this theorem is via ambient Morse theory, but I won&#8217;t try to give the details here. In fact, every homology 3-sphere has an embedded Heegaard diagram which is <em>doubly null</em>, meaning that the linking matrices for <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ciota%28%5Calpha%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;iota(&#92;alpha)' title='&#92;iota(&#92;alpha)' class='latex' /> and <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ciota%28%5Cbeta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;iota(&#92;beta)' title='&#92;iota(&#92;beta)' class='latex' /> vanish. Of course, actually using this theorem to show that <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='Y' title='Y' class='latex' /> doesn&#8217;t embed would involve a lot of work. It seems that we&#8217;d need to consider all possible embeddings of <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CSigma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;Sigma' title='&#92;Sigma' class='latex' />, as well as all possible systems of curves <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;alpha' title='&#92;alpha' class='latex' /> and <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0' alt='&#92;beta' title='&#92;beta' class='latex' />. I think Mike has some ideas about this (if you go &#8220;far out in the mapping class group&#8221;, it should be impossible that the images of the curves are unlinked), but I don&#8217;t think I could reproduce those ideas usefully here. Perhaps some of our readers can comment on how plausible this seems, and maybe if we&#8217;re lucky Mike will turn up too and say some more.</p>

On April 13th, we hosted at NYU Stern the <a href="http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2011/04/nyc-crowdsourcing-meetup-april-13th.html">NYC Crowdsourcing Meetup</a>.&nbsp;For those who missed it, you can now download an&nbsp;<a href="http://echo360.stern.nyu.edu:8080/ess/echo/presentation/3cca744c-8dc7-4c0d-9564-d8868fe3f177/media.mp3">audio-only podcast version</a>, see <a href="http://sterntv.stern.nyu.edu:8080/ramgen/faculty/panos/398259/041311-panos-398259.rm">the online video</a>,&nbsp;or watch the&nbsp;<a href="http://echo360.stern.nyu.edu:8080/ess/echo/presentation/3cca744c-8dc7-4c0d-9564-d8868fe3f177">video from the event together with the slide presentations</a>:<br />

The speakers at the event:<br />
<ul><li><b>John Horton</b>, Staff Economist of oDesk. John talked on issues of matching employers with contractors in an online marketplace. Specifically he described mechanisms for forcing contractors to give an accurate description of their skills, avoiding issues of over-tagging a profile with irrelevant keywords or over-claiming qualifications.</li>
<li><b>Amanda Michel</b>, Director of Distributed Reporting at ProPublica. Amanda talked about the crowdsourcing efforts of ProPublica, and how they use the crowd to enable better journalistic investigation of topics they are researching. At some point during the presentation, Amanda quoted from <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/our-stimulus-spot-check-summer-wave-of-projects-nears-crest-817">one of their studie</a>s "<i>ProPublica pulled a random sample of 520 of the roughly 6,000 approved projects to examine stimulus progress around the country. That sample is large enough to estimate national patterns with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points</i>." Honestly, a tear came down my eye when I compared that with the corresponding practices of Greek newsrooms that typically operate with samples of n=1 or n=0.</li>
<li><b>Todd Carter</b>, CEO and Co-Founder of Tagasauris. Todd described Tagasauris, a system for annotating and tagging media files. Todd described the annotation effort for <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/">Magnum Photos</a>, (sample photos in their collection include the <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=ViewBox_VPage&amp;VBID=2K1HZOXHAFXW3&amp;IT=ZoomImage01_VForm&amp;IID=2S5RYDYF53IF&amp;PN=8&amp;CT=Search">Afghan refugee girl</a>, <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=ViewBox_VPage&amp;VBID=2K1HZOXHAQ5TH&amp;CT=Search&amp;DT=Image">Merilyn Monroe on top of the vent</a>, and many other iconic photos). A highlight was the discovery of a "lost" set of images from the shooting of the movie "American Graffiti". These images, shot by Dennis Stock, were in the Magnum archive but were not possible to find as they were lacking any tags and description. After the annotation effort from Tagasauris, the lost set of photos <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=ViewBox_VPage&amp;VBID=2K1HZOXHARHQF&amp;CT=Search&amp;DT=Image">were re-discovered</a>.</li>
<li><b>Panos Ipeirotis</b>, representing AdSafe Media. I talked about our efforts in AdSafe, on using crowdsourcing in order to create machine learning systems for classifying web pages.</li>

<p>A few years ago, I decided as a public service to post my old <a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2008/10/12/old-application-materials/">job application</a> materials online.  Hopefully they were helpful to a person or two out there in the world.  I also tried to make that blog post a bit of a hint to people that they could do the same; I know <a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2008/11/25/will-math-for-food/">Noah did</a>, and at least one other person said in comments to that post that they would as well.</p>
<p>The problem with such things is that they aren&#8217;t that easy to find even when people put them up.  Being an old fogey who (God I hope) won&#8217;t be applying for jobs any time too soon, I&#8217;m more interested in NSF grant applications (which while lower stakes than job applications are more mystifying), but I don&#8217;t see any need to make a distinction.  I think the world as a whole would be a better place if more people put these documents online.  In that vein, I have a two-part proposal.</p>
<ol>
<li>You (the internet) make your old job application materials and grant applications available online.  You, of course, should use your judgement about how recent to go and what to include.</li>
<li>I will make a webpage collating these; if you put them on your own website, I will link to them.  If you want I can host the documents myself.  Obviously, if you&#8217;d prefer I didn&#8217;t link, that&#8217;s fine too.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ve put a <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/bwebster/grant.html">&#8220;proof of concept&#8221; webpage up</a> with a few examples I already know.  I may look a little bit for more for examples people have posted, but mostly I&#8217;m hoping people will come to me (after all, I don&#8217;t want to give people publicity they don&#8217;t want).</p>

A few thoughts looking out a few years ...<br />
<br />
• Residential investment (RI) is the best leading indicator for the economy. This isn't perfect - nothing is - but RI is usually a strong leading indicator for the business cycle. The slump in RI helped me call the 2007 recession correctly, and the lack of a recovery in residential investment is a key reason the recovery has been sluggish and choppy so far. Note: Residential investment, according to the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> (BEA), includes new single family structures, multifamily structures, home improvement, broker's commissions, and a few minor categories.<br />
<br />
• In 2011, residential investment will make a positive contribution to the economy for the first time since 2005. The five years of drag on GDP from RI (2006 through 2010) is the longest period on record, breaking the previous record of four years from 1930 to 1933 (yeah, the Great Depression). The positive contribution this year will mostly be due to a pickup in multifamily construction (apartments) and in <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/residential-remodeling-index-shows.html">home improvement</a>. However single family housing starts will continue to struggle.<br />
<br />
• This positive contribution from residential investment suggests the economy will continue to grow all year and also in 2012 (point 1: RI is best leading indicator). There are plenty of downside risks, but I expect the expansion to continue.<br />
<br />
• A <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/housing-on-pace-for-record-low.html">record low number of housing units</a> will be added to the housing stock this year. With more jobs, and more household formation in 2011, the number of excess housing units will be reduced substantially this year – perhaps by 600,000 to 700,000 units (or more).<br />
<br />
Recently economist Tom Lawler took <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/03/lawler-census-2010-and-excess-vacant.html">a long look at the 2010 Census data</a>, and estimated there were about 2 to 3 million excess vacant housing units as of April 1, 2010. With the record low number of housing units delivered last year, Lawler estimated that as of April 1, 2011 the excess “would be somewhere in the range of 1.45 to 2.45 million units – with the latter almost certainly too high”. With another record low number of units added to the housing stock this year, the excess will be in the 750 thousand to 1.7 million range next April (with the latter “certainly too high"). This suggests the excess supply will be gone sometime between early 2014 and 2016.<br />
<br />
As the excess supply is absorbed, new residential investment will increase in some areas – and will probably return to normal sometime in 2014 - or as late as 2017 - depending on the actual number of excess vacant housing units. I'm leaning more towards 2015 or 2016.<br />
<br />
• “Normal” for housing starts will be the rate of household formation (probably averaging around 1.1 million per year in 2015), plus the net number of 2nd homes purchased, plus the number of demolitions. I think the 2nd home markets will be slow to recover, so "normal" will probably be around 1.3 million housing starts in 2015 or 2016 or 2017 (after the excess supply is absorbed) – up sharply from the current rate of around 550 thousand. For new home sales, normal will probably be in the 800 thousand to 850 thousand range – far above the recent 250 thousand to 300 thousand range, but also far below the 1.2 to 1.3 million range in 2004 and 2005.<br />
<br />
• Unfortunately it is hard to pin down the timing better right now because the number of excess vacant housing units is uncertain. My guess is housing starts will return to "normal" in 2015 or 2016.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Link to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculatedriskblog</a>!<img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10004977-1611874546558067460?l=www.calculatedriskblog.com' alt='' /></div></div>

It contains an historical survey by Martin Tanner and Wing Wong on <a href="http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.ss/1300108234">the emergence of MCMC Bayesian computation in the 1980&#8242;s</a>, This survey is more focused and more informative than <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2902v5">our global history</a> (also to appear in <strong><em><a href="http://www.imstat.org/sts/">Statistical Science</a></em></strong>). In particular, it provides the authors&#8217; analysis as to why MCMC was delayed by ten years or so (or even more when considering that a Gibbs sampler as a simulation tool appears in both Hastings&#8217; (1970) and <a title="A short history of MCMC [slides]" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/a-short-history-of-mcmc-slides/">Besag</a>&#8216;s (1974) papers). They dismiss [our] concerns about computing power (I was running Monte Carlo simulations on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series">Apple IIe</a> by 1986 and a single mean square error curve evaluation for a James-Stein type estimator would then take close to a weekend!) and Markov innumeracy, rather attributing the reluctance to a lack of confidence into the method. This perspective remains debatable as, apart from Tony O&#8217;Hagan who was <em>then</em> fighting again Monte Carlo methods as being un-Bayesian (1987, JRSS D),  I do not remember any negative attitude at the time about simulation and the immediate spread of the MCMC methods from Alan Gelfand&#8217;s and Adrian Smith&#8217;s presentations of their 1990 paper shows on the opposite that the Bayesian community was ready for the move.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A</strong>nother interesting point made in this historical survey is that Metropolis&#8217; and other Markov chain methods were first presented outside simulation sections of books like Hammersley and Handscomb (1964), Rubinstein (1981) and Ripley (1987), perpetuating the impression that such methods were mostly optimisation or niche specific methods. This is also why <a title="A short history of MCMC [slides]" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/a-short-history-of-mcmc-slides/">Besag&#8217;s earlier works</a> (not mentioned in this survey) did not get wider recognition, until later. Something I was not aware is the appearance of iterative adaptive importance sampling (i.e. <a title="CosmoPMC released" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/cosmopmc-released/">population Monte Carlo</a>) in the Bayesian literature of the 1980&#8242;s, with proposals from Herman van Dijk, Adrian Smith, and others. The appendix about Smith et al. (1985), the 1987 special issue of JRSS D, and the computation contents of <a title="Impresiónes de València 9" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/impresiones-de-valencia-9/">Valencia 3</a> (that I sadly missed for being in the Army!) is also quite informative about the perception of computational Bayesian statistics at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A</strong> missing connection in this survey is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCYQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.math.u-psud.fr%2Fselect%2Fpeople%2Fceleux%2Fpubgc.html&amp;rct=j&amp;q=celeux%20diebolt%20SEM&amp;ei=HeemTZOsFMWi8QO3xoWnBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNER1ExNvW3l6apUnUFwirjYpqkqmw&amp;sig2=-2j23v_JvL61bsYwhkxtvA&amp;cad=rja">Gilles Celeux</a> and Jean Diebolt&#8217;s stochastic EM (or SEM). As early as 1981, with Michel Broniatowski, they proposed a simulated version of EM  for mixtures where the latent variable z was simulated from its conditional distribution rather than replaced with its expectation. So this was the first half of <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345907">the Gibbs sampler for mixtures</a> we completed with Jean Diebolt about ten years later. (Also found in Gelman and King, 1990.) These authors did not get much recognition from the community, though, as they focused almost exclusively on mixtures, used simulation to produce a randomness that would escape the local mode attraction, rather than targeting the posterior distribution, and did not analyse the Markovian nature of their algorithm until later with the simulated annealing EM algorithm.</p>

<p><em>Isabelle Guyon and André Elisseeff</em></p>
<p>Variable and feature selection have become the focus of much research in areas of application for which datasets with tens or hundreds of thousands of variables are available. These areas include text processing of internet documents, gene expression array analysis, and combinatorial chemistry. The objective of variable selection is three-fold: improving the prediction performance of the predictors, providing faster and more cost-effective predictors, and providing a better understanding of the underlying process that generated the data.</p>

<p><em>A.K. Jain, M.N. Murty and P.J. Flynn</em></p>
<p>Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns (observations, data items, or feature vectors) into groups (clusters). The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners.</p>

<p><em>Usama Fayyad, Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro and Padhraic Smyth</em></p>
<p>Data mining and knowledge discovery in databases have been attracting a significant amount of research, industry, and media attention of late. What is all the excitement about? This article provides an overview of this emerging field, clarifying how data mining and knowledge discovery in databases are related both to each other and to related fields, such as machine learning, statistics, and databases.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.khabaza.com/"><strong>Nine Laws of Data Mining</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Tom Khabaza</em></p>
<p>In its current form, data mining as a field of practise came into existence in the 1990s, aided by the emergence of data mining algorithms packaged within workbenches so as to be suitable for business analysts.  Perhaps because of its origins in practice rather than in theory, relatively little attention has been paid to understanding the nature of the data mining process.  The development of the CRISP-DM methodology in the late 1990s was a substantial step towards a standardised description of the process that had already been found successful and was (and is) followed by most practising data miners.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stat.osu.edu/~bli/dmsl/papers/Breiman.pdf"><strong>Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Leo Breiman</em></p>
<p>There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment<br />
has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics.</p>

        <p>A student writes:</p>

<blockquote>I have a question about an earlier recommendation of yours on the election of the prior distribution for the precision hyperparameter of a normal distribution, and a reference for the recommendation. If I recall correctly I have read that you have suggested to use Gamma(1.4, 0.4) instead of Gamma(0.01,0.01) for the prior distribution of the precision hyper parameter of a normal distribution.

<p>I would very much appreciate if you would have the time to point me to this publication of yours. The reason is that I have used the prior distribution (Gamma(1.4, 0.4)) in a study which we now revise for publication, and where a reviewer question the choice of the distribution (claiming that it is too informative!).</p>

<p>I am well aware of that you in recent publications (Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models. Bayesian Analysis; Data Analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models) suggest to model the precision as pow(standard deviation, -2) and to use either a Uniform or a Half-Cauchy distribution. However, since our model was fitted before I saw these publications, I would much like to find your earlier recommendation (which works fine!). </blockquote></p>

<p>My reply:  I've never heard of a Gamma (1.4, 0.4) distribution.  I have no idea where this came from!  But I can believe that it might work well--it would depend on the application.</p>

<p>Gamma (1.4, 0.4)??  Perhaps this was created by matching some moments or quantiles???</p>

With just <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/housing-starts-increase-in-march.html">three months of data</a> for 2011, it is already pretty clear that there will be a record low number of housing completions this year. Here is a look at the data so far ...<br />
<br />
In general multi-family housing starts are trending up. Apartment owners are seeing falling vacancy rates, and some have started to plan for 2012 and will be breaking ground this year. However it takes about <a href="http://www.census.gov/const/avg_starttocomp.pdf">13 months on average</a> to complete a multi-family building, and the low level of starts in 2010 means a low level of completions this year.<br />
<br />
The following graph shows this lag between multi-family starts and completions through March:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Housing#category=Housing&amp;chart=MultiFamilyStartCompMach2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1110,height=820,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Multifamily Starts and completions" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zvXdfREIbDc/Ta3C7baEimI/AAAAAAAAKKU/O0fULAoNg_s/s320/MultiFamilyStartCompMach2011.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a> <i><b><span style="font-size: 85%;">Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.</span></b></i><br />
<br />
The blue line is for multifamily starts and the red line is for multifamily completions. Since multifamily starts collapsed in 2009, completions collapsed in 2010. <br />
<br />
Notice that the blue line (Starts) is now trending up, and the red line (completions) is still falling. Based on starts in 2010, I expect mutlifamily completions to be around 100 thousand in 2011 - well below the 146.5 thousand in 2010, and below the previous record low of 127.1 thousand in 1993.<br />
<br />
We can do a similar analysis for single family housing completions. Through March, about 90 thousand units have been completed (1 to 4 unit structures), and based on housing starts, another 200 thousand or so will be completed over the next 6 months (it takes about 6 months on average to complete single family structures). Even if starts increase over the next few months, it seems likely that 1 to 4 unit completions will be in the 400 thousand to 450 thousand range for the year - well below the previous record low of 505 thousand set in 2010.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html?Housing#category=Housing&amp;chart=HousingCompletionsAnnualMarch2011.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=1070,height=780,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Total Housing Starts and Single Family Housing Starts" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uhiGvOxD7hU/Ta3C66ISR2I/AAAAAAAAKKQ/3g7BJcQIr-8/s320/HousingCompletionsAnnualMarch2011.jpg" style="border-bottom: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; border-top: rgb(0,0,0) 1px solid; float: right; margin: 10px;" /></a>This graph shows annual completions for 1 to 4 units, 5+ units and manufactured homes (and an estimate for 2011)<br />
<br />
In 2010, 1 to 4 unit completions were at a record low 505 thousand. This was just below the 535 thousand units completed in 2009 and was far below the previous record low of 712 thousand units in 1982.  1 to 4 units completions are currently on pace for another record low in 2011.<br />
<br />
For 5+ units, completions were at 147 thousand units in 2010. This was just above the record low of 127 thousand in 1993 - and that record will be broken in 2011.<br />
<br />
This doesn't include demolitions that were probably in the 200 thousand unit range (some estimate are as high as 300 thousand). This suggest the excess supply was reduced in 2010, and will probably be significantly reduced in 2011. Of course this also depends on household formation - and that means jobs.<br />
<br />
Here is a table of housing units added to stock by year:<br />

</tbody></table><br />
<sup>1</sup> Estimates for 2011.<br />
<sup>2</sup> Demolitions estimated (extra conservative for last few years).<br />
<br />
This means a record low number of housing units will be added to the housing stock in 2011. <br />

<p>In an op-ed for CNN and perhaps adding fuel to the <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/04/17/business-intelligence-vs-infotainment/">fire</a>, Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas, leaders of Google's <em>Big Picture</em> project, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/04/19/sexy.data/">talk visualization and its future</a>.</p>
<p>In reference to rules of simplicity and the data-to-ink ratio derived from <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2010/03/20/graphical-perception-learn-the-fundamentals-first/">works</a> such as that of William Cleveland and Robert McGill:</p>
<blockquote><p>The single-minded pursuit of clarity and precision led to designs that were, sure enough, clear and precise. Grid lines receded discreetly into the background; Tufte's beloved beiges and tans became standard recommendations. </p></blockquote>
<p>However, is there something more? Using Hans Rosling's <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html">widely-viewed TED talk</a> as an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Was animation really the most precise way to show the data? Probably not, but the motion, color, and energy helped capture the imagination of millions of viewers across the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, Viegas and Wattenberg end with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Emotions and a strong voice aren't necessarily sins in other media, and they shouldn't be in visualization, either. By recognizing that being expressive and engaging doesn't mean giving up clarity, we will have fulfilled the promise of visualization.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's common to look at data through a factual lens, where all meaning and insight is quantitative. This fits well in many settings, but there are other stories to tell that are personal and even moving. </p>

<p><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>: [...] Complex networks can often be decomposed into less complex sub-networks whose structures can give hints about the functional organization of the network as a whole. However, these structural motifs can only tell one part of the functional story because in this analysis each node and edge is treated on an equal footing. In real networks, two motifs that are topologically identical but whose nodes perform very different functions will play very different roles in the network. Here, we combine structural information derived from the topology of the neuronal network of the nematode C. elegans with information about the biological function of these nodes, thus coloring nodes by function. We discover that particular colorations of motifs are significantly more abundant in the worm brain than expected by chance, and have particular computational functions that emphasize the feed-forward structure of information processing in the network, while evading feedback loops. Interneurons are strongly over-represented among the common motifs, supporting the notion that these motifs process and transduce the information from the sensor neurons towards the muscles. Some of the most common motifs identified in the search for significant colored motifs play a crucial role in the system of neurons controlling the worm&#8217;s locomotion. The analysis of complex networks in terms of colored motifs combines two independent data sets to generate insight about these networks that cannot be obtained with either data set alone. The method is general and should allow a decomposition of any complex networks into its functional (rather than topological) motifs as long as both wiring and functional information is available. [...] from Qian J, Hintze A, Adami C (2011) <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017013" target="_blank">Colored Motifs Reveal Computational Building Blocks in the C. elegans Brain</a>, PLoS ONE 6(3): e17013. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017013</p>
<p>[...] The role of evolution in producing these patterns is clear, said <em>Adami</em>. &#8220;Selection favors those motifs that impart high fitness to the organism, and suppresses those that work against the task at hand.&#8221; In this way, the efficient and highly functional motifs (such as the sensory neuron-interneuron-motor neuron motif) are very common in the nervous system, while those that would waste energy and give no benefit to, or even harm, the animal are not found in the network. &#8220;<em>Adami</em> and his team have used evolutionary computation to develop hypotheses about the evolution of neural circuits and find, for these nematode worms, that simplicity is the rule,&#8221; says <em>George Gilchrist</em>, program director in NSF&#8217;s Division of Environmental Biology (in the Directorate for Biological Sciences), which funds BEACON. &#8220;By including functional information about each node in the circuit, they have begun decoding the role of natural selection in shaping the architecture of neural circuits.&#8221; [...] from Danielle J.

<div>Description: </div>
<div>Content:
It is the time of year in the US that high school students have found out what schools have accepted them and now have to decide where to spend the next four years. Maybe because I am of that age, but I find myself talking more to students and parents about what school they should choose.<br />
<br />
So let's assume you are a high school student who knows they will eventually want to get a Ph.D. in computational complexity or perhaps some other math-related topic. Where to go to school? Depends much on your personality and your choices.<br />
<br />
<b>The Elites</b> (examples: Princeton, Harvard, Stanford, Yale): Many rich kids who feel entitled so you can get good grades without working hard. But you can also take advantage of great professors and some challenging courses and research opportunities if you are up to the challenge.<br />
<br />
<b>Intense Schools&nbsp;</b>(MIT, Caltech, U. Chicago): Here you have to work hard for your grades against other very strong students in challenging courses. You won't have a better math/science education anywhere else but these schools won't give you as broad a social experience.<br />
<br />
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Broad Private School</b></span>s<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"> (Cornell, Northwestern): Here I have biases having gone to Cornell undergrad and now teach at Northwestern. Fine math and science programs not quite as strong as the above but more than made up by experiencing an undergraduate life with smart students across a wide spectrum of disciplines. Many a theorist got their start as a Cornell undergrad.</span></b><br />
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></b><br />
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Liberal Arts Schools</b></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">(Williams, Wesleyan, Harvey Mudd): You don't get the large research programs but instead have very good profs who focus on undergrad teaching. This is the easiest way to get involved in research as an undergrad.</span></b><br />
<b><br /></b><br />
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"></span>Big State Schools </b>(Illinois, U. California, Michigan, Wisconsin): You get a real mix of students from athletes to partiers to really smart kids looking to save a few dollars. You can certainly get a great math and science education. But you'll have to work hard when many of your fellow students may not be.<br />
<br />
<b>General advice</b>: Doesn't really matter that much where you go, as long as you work hard you will succeed. Above all enjoy your undergrad days for they will be the best times of your life.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3722233-2684006466416655304?l=blog.computationalcomplexity.org' alt='' /></div></div>

Copyright © 2011 http://jtonedm.com James Taylor<br><br /><p><a href="../../../../../../2010/05/06/first-look-revolution-analytics/">Revolution Analytics</a> and Netezza have recently announced a <a href="http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/news-events/news-room/2011/revolution-analytics-netezza-partnership.php">partnership</a>. Netezza has a strong history of being associated with customers that are focused on “big data” problems and advanced analytics. As a result they have been delivering in-database analytics to bring these analytics closer to the data. Their approach allows customers and partners to bring Java, Python,C/C++ Fortan or whatever into the database to execute right by the data and has been used by a number of analytic companies (including <a href="../../../../../../2011/03/07/first-look-sas-high-performance-computing/">SAS</a> and Angoss) to create in-database analytic offerings. The popularity of R has been growing in the Netezza customer base, as it has almost everywhere. This demand is coming from new companies with no prior predictive analytic capabilities, established analytic users who are adding R to their toolkit and some long term R users looking for a more robust, commercial ready platform. To meet this demand Netezza have partnered with Revolution Analytic to port their commercial distribution of R to the Netezza APIs. The companies plan to have it released by the end of the summer.</p>
<p>The offering will support both the creation of models in-database and the execution of the models in database. Thus routines that build models will be able to execute in-database while a model is being developed and the model itself will be able to execute in-database, allowing it to be calculated live when it is needed as part of a database query. As always the benefit of in-database analytics is to eliminate the data movement time.</p>
<p>Once the product is released, companies will be able to use R packages and run them in the Netezza TwinFin appliance. R packages can be applied to a number of data slices in parallel and then aggregated up once they are complete. In addition, Netezza provides a collection of analytic routines that are explicitly parallelized to take full advantage of the distributed computing architecture in the Netezza appliance, and operate on the entire dataset.</p>
<p>Demand is coming from all verticals and, at least in terms of early adopters, is evenly split between companies that want to embed predictive analytics into reports and dashboards (predictive reporting) and those who want to embed in operational systems (decision management). While Revolution Analytics sees more overall demand for predictive reporting there is a higher percentage of those doing decision management that needs the kind of performance that drives in-database demand.</p>
<p>You can get more details on how the combined solution will work <a href="http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/partners/netezza/">here</a>.</p>

<div>Content:
<p>You may have seen <code>sed</code> programs even if you didn&#8217;t know that&#8217;s what they were. In online discussions it&#8217;s common to hear someone say</p>
<pre>s/foo/bar/</pre>
<p>as a shorthand to mean &#8220;replace foo with bar.&#8221; The line <code>s/foo/bar/</code> is a complete <code>sed</code> program to do such a replacement.</p>
<p><code>sed</code> comes with every Unix-like operating system and is available for Windows <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm">here</a>. It has a range of features for editing files, but <code>sed</code> is worth using even if you only know how to do one thing with it:</p>
<pre>sed "s/<em>pattern1</em>/<em>pattern2</em>/g" file.txt &gt; newfile.txt</pre>
<p>This will replace every instance of <em>pattern1</em> with <em>pattern2</em> in the file <code>file.txt</code> and will write the result to <code>newfile.txt</code>. The original file <code>file.txt</code> is unchanged.</p>
<p>I used to think there was no reason to use <code>sed</code> when other languages like Python will do everything <code>sed</code> does and much more. Suppose you agree with that. Now suppose you find you often have to make global search-and-replace operations and so you write a script to do this, say a Python script. You&#8217;ve got to call your script something, remember what you called it, and put it in your path. How about calling it <code>sed</code>? Or better, <em>don&#8217;t</em> write your script, but pretend that you did. If you&#8217;re on Linux, it&#8217;s already in your path. One advantage of the real <code>sed</code> over your script named <code>sed</code> is that the former can do a lot more, should you ever need it to.</p>
<p>Now for a few details regarding the <code>sed</code> command above. The &#8220;s&#8221; on the front stands for &#8220;substitute&#8221; and the &#8220;g&#8221; on the end stands for &#8220;global.&#8221; Without the &#8220;g&#8221; on the end, <code>sed</code> would only replace the first instance of the pattern on each line. If that&#8217;s what you want, then remove the &#8220;g.&#8221;</p>
<p>The patterns inside a <code>sed</code> command are regular expressions, so it&#8217;s best to get in the habit of always quoting <code>sed</code> commands. This isn&#8217;t necessary for simple string substitutions, but regular expressions often contain characters that you&#8217;ll need to prevent the shell from interpreting.</p>
<p>You may find the default regular expression support in <code>sed</code> odd or restrictive. If you&#8217;re used to regular expressions in Perl, Python, JavaScript, etc. and you&#8217;re using a Gnu implementation of <code>sed</code>, you can add the <code>-r</code> option for more familiar regular expression syntax.</p>
<p>I got the idea for this post from Greg Grouthaus&#8217; post <a href="http://gregable.com/2010/09/why-you-should-know-just-little-awk.html">Why you should learn just a little Awk</a>. He makes a good case that you can benefit from learning just a few commands of a language like Awk with no intention to learn more of the language.</p>

<div>Description: An embodiment of a method of ordering operations begins with a first step of a computing entity storing a training data set, which includes previously executed operation pairs, attribute data, and relative cost data. In a second step, the computing entity forms a predictor. In a third step, the computing entity applies the predictor to an operation pair of first and second to-be-executed operations to determine a predicted relative cost between the first and second to-be-executed operations. Another embodiment of the method comprises the first step, the second step, an alternative third step, and a fourth step. In the alternative third step, the computing entity applies the predictor to to-be-executed operations in operation pairs to determine a predicted relative cost between first and second operations for each operation pair. In the fourth step, the computing entity employs the operation pairs and the predicted relative costs to sort the to-be-executed operations.</div>

<div>Description: <html><p>Malheur is a tool for the automatic analysis of malware behavior (program behavior recorded from malicious software in a sandbox environment). It has been designed to support the regular analysis of malicious software and the development of detection and defense measures. Malheur allows for identifying novel classes of malware with similar behavior and assigning unknown malware to discovered classes.
</p>
<p>Malheur builds on the concept of dynamic analysis: Malware binaries are collected in the wild and executed in a sandbox, where their behavior is monitored during run-time. The execution of each malware binary results in a report of recorded behavior. Malheur analyzes these reports for discovery and discrimination of malware classes using machine learning.
</p>

<html><p>Malheur is a tool for the automatic analysis of malware behavior (program behavior recorded from malicious software in a sandbox environment). It has been designed to support the regular analysis of malicious software and the development of detection and defense measures. Malheur allows for identifying novel classes of malware with similar behavior and assigning unknown malware to discovered classes.
</p>
<p>Malheur builds on the concept of dynamic analysis: Malware binaries are collected in the wild and executed in a sandbox, where their behavior is monitored during run-time. The execution of each malware binary results in a report of recorded behavior. Malheur analyzes these reports for discovery and discrimination of malware classes using machine learning.

<p>Malheur can be applied to recorded behavior of various format, as long as monitored events are separated by delimiter symbols, for example as in reports generated by the popular malware sandboxes CWSandbox, Anubis, Norman Sandbox and Joebox.

        <p>The following is an essay into a topic I know next to nothing about.</p>

<p>As part of our endless discussion of Dilbert and Charlie Sheen, commenter Fraac <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2011/04/the_difference_7.html#comment-2287407">linked</a> to a blog by philosopher Edouard Machery, who tells a <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/experiments-in-philosophy/200811/do-you-have-aspergers-syndrome">fascinating story</a>:</p>

<blockquote>How do we think about the intentional nature of actions? And how do people with an impaired mindreading capacity think about it?

<p>Consider the following probes: </p>

<p>The Free-Cup Case<br />
<blockquote>Joe was feeling quite dehydrated, so he stopped by the local smoothie shop to buy the largest sized drink available. Before ordering, the cashier told him that if he bought a Mega-Sized Smoothie he would get it in a special commemorative cup. Joe replied, 'I don't care about a commemorative cup, I just want the biggest smoothie you have.' Sure enough, Joe received the Mega-Sized Smoothie in a commemorative cup. Did Joe intentionally obtain the commemorative cup?</blockquote></p>

<p>The Extra-Dollar Case<br />
<blockquote>Joe was feeling quite dehydrated, so he stopped by the local smoothie shop to buy the largest sized drink available. Before ordering, the cashier told him that the Mega-Sized Smoothies were now one dollar more than they used to be. Joe replied, 'I don't care if I have to pay one dollar more, I just want the biggest smoothie you have.' Sure enough, Joe received the Mega-Sized Smoothie and paid one dollar more for it. Did Joe intentionally pay one dollar more?</blockquote></p>

<p>You surely think that paying an extra dollar was intentional, while getting the commemorative cup was not. [Indeed, I do--AG.]  So do most people (Machery, 2008).</p>

<p>But Tiziana Zalla and I [Machery] have found that if you had Asperger Syndrome, a mild form of autism, your judgments would be very different: You would judge that paying an extra-dollar was not intentional, just like getting the commemorative cup.</blockquote></p>

<p>I'm not particularly interested in the Asperger's angle (except for the linguistic oddity that most people call it Asperger's but in the medical world it's called Asperger; compare, for example, the headline of the linked blog to its text), but I am fascinated by the above experiment.  Even after reading the description, it seems to me perfectly natural to think of the free cup as unintentional and the extra dollar as intentional.  But I also agree with the implicit point that, in a deeper sense, the choice to pay the extra dollar isn't <em>really</em> more intentional than the choice to take the cup.  It just feels that way.</p>

<p>To engage in a bit of introspective reasoning (as is traditional in in the "heuristics and biases" field), I'd say the free cup just happened whereas in the second scenario Joe had to decide to pay the dollar.</p>

<p>But that's not really it.  The passive/active division correctly demarcates the free cup and extra dollar examples, but Machery presents other examples where both scenarios are passive, or where both scenarios are active, and you can get perceived intentionality or lack of intentionality in either case.  (Just as we learned from classical decision theory and the First Law of Robotics, to not decide is itself a decision.)</p>

<p><strong>Machery's explanation (which I don't buy)</strong></p>
        <p>So what <em>is</em> going on?  In <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~machery/papers/The%20folk%20concept%20of%20intentionality_machery.pdf">his 2008 article</a>, "The Folk Concept of Intentional Action: Philosophical and Experimental Issues," Machery proposes what he calls the trade-off hypothesis.  I'll state this explanation and then explain why I'm skeptical (of Machery's theoretical explanation, not of his experiments, which I think are great).</p>

<p>Machery argues that (most) people see intentionality in settings with a "trade-off between a cost and a benefit."  In the free-cup example there is no tradeoff (Joe gets the cup and his extra-large smoothie) hence no feeling of intentionality, whereas in the extra-dollar case there is a tradeoff (Joe gets his drink but has to pay more) hence it does feel intentional.</p>

<p>The trade-off hypothesis works for this example but I don't think it's the key to intentionality.</p>

<p>Here's why I say this.  Consider the following two (hypothetical) new probes:</p>

<blockquote>The No-Free-Cup Case
<blockquote>Joe was feeling quite dehydrated, so he stopped by the local smoothie shop to buy the largest sized drink available. Before ordering, the cashier told him that if he bought a Mega-Sized Smoothie he would <em>no longer</em> get it in a special commemorative cup. Joe replied, 'I don't care about a commemorative cup, I just want the biggest smoothie you have.' Sure enough, Joe received the Mega-Sized Smoothie in a regular cup. Did Joe intentionally obtain the regular cup?</blockquote>

<p>The One-Less-Dollar Case<br />
<blockquote>Joe was feeling quite dehydrated, so he stopped by the local smoothie shop to buy the largest sized drink available. Before ordering, the cashier told him that the Mega-Sized Smoothies were now one dollar <em>less</em> than they used to be. Joe replied, 'I don't care if I have to pay one dollar more, I just want the biggest smoothie you have.' Sure enough, Joe received the Mega-Sized Smoothie and paid one dollar less for it. Did Joe intentionally pay one dollar less?</blockquote></blockquote></p>

<p>How would you answer these?  I'd say:  No intentionality for the no-free-cup, and yes on intentionality for the one-less-dollar.  I'm not claiming these are the <em>correct</em> answers (whatever that means), but I think that's how I would answer them.</p>

<p>But if I'm right--in the sense that most people would answer these the way I would--then this is a counterexample to Machery's hypothesis.</p>

<p>To me, the key is that the cup is incidental but the cost of the smoothie is central.  Or maybe it's that the cashier is giving Joe the cup whereas it's Joe himself who's paying.  I'm not sure.  But I think there's something going on here.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>B</strong>efore you rush sending me papers to referee, let me stress that this post title is ironical! I am not asking for more papers to referee! What happened to me over the weekend is that I had agreed to referee one ERC (ERC stands for <a href="http://erc.europa.eu/index.cfm">European Research Council</a>) proposal due today and that, when I tried to read the proposal and write my on-line report, I was denied access. What transpired is that I had not faxed a signed copy of my agreement to referee the proposal&#8230;. As if an email was not enough. So, in the end, as the deadline was getting near and I did not want to penalise the researcher(s), I had to waste the 15mn required to print, sign and fax the form. About as silly as the persistence of the written signature on paper copyrights!</p>

<div>Content:
<p>A press person recently asked about:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; start-ups that are building technologies to enable MySQL and other SQL databases to get over some of the problems they have in scaling past a certain size. &#8230; I’d like to get a sense as to whether or not the problems are as severe and wide spread as these companies are telling me? If so, why wouldn’t a customer just move to a new database?</p></blockquote>
<p>While that sounds as if he was asking about scale-out relational DBMS in general, MySQL or otherwise, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2011/03/30/short-request-and-analytic-processing/">short-request or analytic</a>, it turned out that he was asking just about <strong>short-request scale-out MySQL.</strong> My thoughts and comments on that narrower subject include(d) but are not limited to: <span id="more-4329"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest web companies had to go to non-<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2011/02/24/transparent-sharding/">transparently sharded</a> MySQL years ago. The NoSQL movement is, in no small part, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2010/03/02/cassandra-nosql-scalable-oltp/">an attempt to improve upon that</a>. Ditto for scale-out short-request MySQL.</li>
<li>Some overlapping categories of companies or projects who need scale-out short-request database processing are:
<ul>
<li>The aforementioned big companies who have other applications they haven&#8217;t hand-sharded yet.</li>
<li>Other web companies whose applications are getting that big.</li>
<li>Conventional enterprises whose web efforts happen to be very big.</li>
<li>Sensor networks and other massive sources of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2010/12/30/examples-and-definition-of-machine-generated-data/">machine-generated data</a>.</li>
<li>Certain specialized areas (e.g., financial trading).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Relatively few of these applications are totally impossible to do in Oracle. But the Oracle approach might be very expensive.</li>
<li>In particular, there&#8217;s a break point when companies &#8212; often SaaS vendors &#8212; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2011/04/01/the-client-that-was-confused-about-security/">outgrow Oracle Standard Edition</a>.</li>
<li>Yes, the alternatives usually are one of MySQL or Oracle.</li>
<li>InnoDB isn&#8217;t an alternative to these newer technologies; it&#8217;s just a piece of the puzzle and indeed of default MySQL now. Several of them &#8212; e.g. dbShards &#8212; are meant to be used in conjunction with InnoDB.</li>
<li>Merging his list and mine, the high-performance/scale-out MySQL alternatives look like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2011/01/25/dbshards-update/">dbShards</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2011/01/28/schooner-software-onl/">Schooner</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2011/01/25/scalebase-another-mpp-oltp-quasi-dbms/">ScaleBase</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2008/04/13/scaledb-presents-the-revenge-of-the-pointer/">ScaleDB</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2009/04/16/introduction-to-tokutek/">Tokutek</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2010/04/03/akiban-highlights/">Akiban</a>, Xeround, and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2010/05/12/the-clustrix-story/">Clustrix</a>. The first two are to my knowledge more proven than the rest.</li>
<li>Proprietary hardware and the associated hardware/appliance pricing aren&#8217;t very appealing for these applications. That speaks against Oracle Exadata and Clustrix, and is the reason Schooner switched to a software-only strategy despite some initial appliance sales.</li>
<li>However, hardware band-aids such as solid-state drives or even <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2010/10/19/introduction-to-kaminario/">RAM-based solid-state storage</a> could make more sense:
<ul>
<li>If, for performance, you&#8217;ve scaling out your database so that it fits in RAM on each box, you don&#8217;t really have a disk-based architecture anyway, now do you?</li>
<li>Even if you&#8217;re not doing that yet &#8212; if your problem is throughput rather than storage capacity, silicon-based storage could be a big help.</li>
<li>In principle, devices of that kind can be moved from one application to another, after the first one is rearchitected not to need them. (In practice, however, I don&#8217;t know of anybody who is doing that. I also don&#8217;t believe that Kaminario et al. are marketing that kind of idea, more&#8217;s the pity.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My notes on all this from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dbms2.com/2010/04/05/oltp-database-management-systems-2/">April, 2010</a> are already badly outdated, but may be interesting anyway.</li>

<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ErB66uG6mDs/TaYUbttZHDI/AAAAAAAAEmI/1TFw6tlizE8/s1600/achievable-decodable.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ErB66uG6mDs/TaYUbttZHDI/AAAAAAAAEmI/1TFw6tlizE8/s320/achievable-decodable.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1104/1104.2215v1.pdf">Sparse Representation of White Gaussian Noise with Application to l_0-Norm Decoding in Noisy Compressed Sensing</a> by&nbsp;<a href="http://cmrr-star.ucsd.edu/oshental/">Ori Shental</a>. The abstract reads:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">The achievable and converse regions for sparse representation of white Gaussian noise based on an overcomplete dictionary are derived in the limit of large systems. Furthermore, the marginal distribution of such sparse representations is also inferred. The results are obtained via the Replica method which stems from statistical mechanics. A direct outcome of these results is the introduction of sharp threshold for l_0-norm decoding in noisy compressed sensing, and its mean-square error for underdetermined Gaussian vector channels.</div></blockquote><br />
I need to think some more about this paper as this idea of noise being "compressible" must have some other implications in the multiplicative noise case....Thanks&nbsp;<a href="http://cmrr-star.ucsd.edu/oshental/">Ori</a>&nbsp;for the heads-up.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><!-- Site Meter XHTML Strict 1.0 -->

<br />
<blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1104/1104.2215v1.pdf">This work</a> doesn't contradict in any way the well-known fact that WGN is non-compressible. In this work we discuss sparse representation of noise *realizations* given certain dictionary *realizations*. Still the indices of the non-zero entries of the sparse representation of WGN will differ from one WGN instance to another such that in order to describe the ensemble of *all* WGN realizations one would need at least as the length of the observed WGN vector (i.e. k&gt;=m). So no real compression here, just sparse representation of noise realizations. Thus saying the noise is "compressible" (in quotation marks) is in place.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">On the second part of the paper, we use this observed "compressibility" of WGN to translate the noisy CS/channel problem to a noiseless one with denser effective input, allowing us to derive some new results on the former based on already known results about the latter. Still, I share your feeling that there are a lot of other applications to this (e.g. multiplicative noise channel as you say, etc.). Another interesting task down the road is to repeat this analysis under the practical L1-norm constraint, rather than the theoretical L0-norm.</div></blockquote><br />

<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/oYwvwY7bRx2hOIFfDpBLrs7oEuw/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/oYwvwY7bRx2hOIFfDpBLrs7oEuw/0/di" border="0" ismap="true"></img></a><br/>

It started because I was intrigued by what <a href="http://cmrr-star.ucsd.edu/oshental/">Ori Shental</a> <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2011/04/cs-precision-by-ori-shental.html">stated</a> <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2011/04/cs-did-you-realize-gaussian-noise-could.html">earlier</a> and so I went ahead and tried a small experiment. Given a Gaussian vector of size m x 1, a Gaussian dictionary of size m x N, how sparse is this Gaussian vector as a function of the elements of the dictionary ? Can I get a sparse decomposition of this Gaussian noise realization with respect to the elements of the dictionary ?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In short, we are solving for x, with y = A x, where y is the known Gaussian vector et A the dictionary. In order to investigate this, I wrote a small script that uses <a href="http://ee.sharif.ir/~SLzero/">SL0 solver</a> and here it is for m =50 and N varying from 1 to 600. &nbsp;This is an attempt at seeing something, much like what pirates do. Obviously there are issues with the script such as for instance my criterion of 0.01, but here it is:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><br />
<br />
<blockquote>clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sigma_min = 0.00004;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sdf=0.95;<br />
m =50;<br />
itr = 10;<br />
for N = 1:600<br />
sta(N)=0;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;for ii=1:itr;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;y = randn(m,1);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A = randn(m,N);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;x = SL0(A, y, sigma_min,sdf);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xsol = gt(abs(x),0.01);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;spars = sum(xsol);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sta(N) = sta(N)+spars;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;end<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sta(N) = sta(N)/itr;<br />
end<br />
plot(sta)</blockquote><br />
<br />
and this is what we get running this script:<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DFrTZX-Q5o4/Tagc8bvUT1I/AAAAAAAAEmU/aiZkNl9qiic/s1600/wgn-sparse.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DFrTZX-Q5o4/Tagc8bvUT1I/AAAAAAAAEmU/aiZkNl9qiic/s400/wgn-sparse.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">One can see rather quickly that a 50 elements Gaussian vector can be decomposed on average with 40 elements of a 100 elements dictionary. That number goes down to 35 with 300 elements or a sparsity fraction of 0.7 ! Intuitively, we are expecting that fraction to be 1, i.e. the realization of that vector to be full.</div><br />

<br />
<ul><li>produce graphs with labels</li>
<li>provide a second map that features the variables used by <a href="http://cmrr-star.ucsd.edu/oshental/">Ori Shental</a> in <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1104/1104.2215v1.pdf">his paper</a></li>
</ul><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">Instead of <a href="http://ee.sharif.ir/~SLzero/">SL0</a>, I have tried the simple basis pursuit of <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/spgl1/">SPGL1</a> and it doesn't work, i.e. I cannot find a "compressible decomposition" of the realization of a Gaussian vector. I have not tried any other L_1 solvers (including LASSO or Dantzig Selector...) so <u>there are ample experiments to perform here</u>. I was also told that m might be too small and what was observed was a fluke. So instead of m = 50, I went for m =250, <b><i><u>the effect is larger</u></i></b>. Here are the figures for <a href="http://ee.sharif.ir/~SLzero/">SL0</a>:</div><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zpIrsFFUVJs/TahorF5VkvI/AAAAAAAAEmY/4qmN7bz7iFE/s1600/gaussian-decomposition-m250.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zpIrsFFUVJs/TahorF5VkvI/AAAAAAAAEmY/4qmN7bz7iFE/s400/gaussian-decomposition-m250.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VyIDm0QU2oo/TahotYtiEMI/AAAAAAAAEmc/_5gGGPYef8o/s1600/oris-phase-transition.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VyIDm0QU2oo/TahotYtiEMI/AAAAAAAAEmc/_5gGGPYef8o/s400/oris-phase-transition.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>Here is the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/igorcarron2/cs/replica.m?attredirects=0&amp;d=1">attendant script</a>. I used the new variable kappa = k/N and alpha = m/N. Let me summarize what the first figure says:<br />
<br />
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><u>Given a Gaussian vector of size 250, a Gaussian dictionary made up of 2500 Gaussian realization will on average provide a decomposition of said vector with as few as 148 elements of the dictionary with a 1% error.</u></blockquote><br />
One can note that the second figure shows a relatively small region of interest compared to the one found by&nbsp;<a href="http://cmrr-star.ucsd.edu/oshental/">Ori</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1104/1104.2215v1.pdf">his paper</a>. Is it a question of using a different solver ? and if so which one ? Otherwise I have also noticed that it may be dependent on m but my small computer cannot handle this. To check if this is the case, one could modify the code from<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>m =250;<br />
itr = 10;<br />
for N = m:100:2500</blockquote><br />
with<br />

<blockquote>m =1000;<br />
itr = 10;<br />

<br />
<blockquote>Hi Igor,<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">I looked at your post today and it seems to me that you are learning about statistics of ordered independent normals :)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I suggest a simpler experiment. Take a long Gaussian vector with mean zero and variance 1 and assume that your dictionary is the identity. The best sparse approximation simply keeps the largest entries. Now in the spirit of your simulations, set a threshold at 0.25, say. That is, discard all the entries with magnitude less than 0.25.   Since P(|Z| \lt 0.25) ~ 0.2, you will discard about 20% of the entries. You can also calculate the relative MSE, the average relative squared error. This will be about 4 10^-3.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Now as N increases in your experiment, it is no surprise that things ``get better''. In the limit where N is infinity, every vector will be 1-sparse in your dictionary. In fact as N gets exponentially large in the dimension, they will all be nearly 1-sparse.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Emmanuel</div></blockquote>Thanks&nbsp;<a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~candes/">Emmanuel</a>.<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">I agree with&nbsp;<a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~candes/">Emmanuel</a>&nbsp;that asymptotically, as N grows, we have a ideal Lena problem, you know the one where one has a dictionary with an element being a full Lena. While the example of the identity dictionary is self explanatory, I am still somehow surprised at the 30 percent drop for a 1 percent accuracy shown in the <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2011/04/cs-compressible-realization-of-gaussian.html">previous entries</a>. I note that this drop varies and is dependent on the solver being used. The previous entry showed the encouraging results for <a href="http://ee.sharif.ir/~SLzero/">SL0</a>. Here are less encouraging results for the Basis Pursuit/<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/spgl1/">SPGL1</a>.</div><br />

Let us recall what that figure showed for that solver:<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">here is a new paper that showed up on my radar screen:&nbsp;<a href="http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/58/56/94/PDF/ISBI_2011_paperReady.pdf">Spherical polar Fourier EAP and ODF reconstruction Via Compressed Sensing in Diffusion MRI</a>&nbsp;by <a href="https://gforge.inria.fr/users/smerlet/">Sylvain Merlet</a>, <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Jian.Cheng/content/home.html">Jian Cheng</a>,<a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/odyssee/en/node/64"> Aurobrata Ghosh</a> and <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/odyssee/en/rachid.deriche">Rachid Deriche</a>. The abstract reads:</div><br />
<blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">In diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP), also known as the propagator, describes completely the water molecule diffusion in the brain white matter without any prior knowledge about the tissue shape. In this paper, we describe a new and efﬁcient method to accurately reconstruct the EAP in terms of the Spherical Polar Fourier (SPF) basis from very few diffusion weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRI). This approach nicely exploits the duality between SPF and a closely related basis in which one can respectively represent the EAP and the diffusion signal using the same coefﬁcients, and efﬁciently combines it to the recent acquisition and reconstruction technique called Compressed Sensing (CS). Our work provides an efﬁcient analytical solution to estimate, from few measurements, the diffusion propagator at any radius. We also provide a new analytical solution to extract an important feature characterising the tissue microstructure: the Orientation Distribution Function (ODF). We illustrate and prove the effectiveness of our method in reconstructing the propagator and the ODF on both noisy multiple q-shell synthetic and phantom data.</div></blockquote><br />
and here is an abstract: <a href="http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v106/i15/e154101">Predicting Catastrophes in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems by Compressive Sensing</a> by Wen-Xu Wang, Rui Yang, Ying-Cheng Lai, Vassilios Kovanis, and Celso Grebogi. The abstract reads:<br />
<blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">An extremely challenging problem of significant interest is to predict catastrophes in advance of their occurrences. We present a general approach to predicting catastrophes in nonlinear dynamical systems under the assumption that the system equations are completely unknown and only time series reflecting the evolution of the dynamical variables of the system are available. Our idea is to expand the vector field or map of the underlying system into a suitable function series and then to use the compressive-sensing technique to accurately estimate the various terms in the expansion. Examples using paradigmatic chaotic systems are provided to demonstrate our idea.</div></blockquote>Finally, here is s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.toshiba.eu/eu/Telecommunications-Research-Laboratory/DHPA-PhD-Vacancy-Compressive-Sensing/">PhD studentship with Toshiba and University of Bristol</a>:<br />

</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The project is entitled “Compressive sensing for M2M applications including healthcare and smart energy”. Compressive sensing is the exploitation of certain characteristics of a signal such that less sampled data (less than Nyquist rate) can be used to reconstruct the signal. In the context of this proposal, compressive sensing is especially useful in reducing the required amount of sensor data to be acquired, such that these can be wirelessly transmitted at a low rate. As the data cannot be reconstructed in the normal way, it will also provide a means of protecting the privacy of the user. In this project, the student will look at ways of designing compressive sensing algorithm to exploit sparsity in M2M data such as biomedical signals or smart energy sensor data. However, the design will have to take special care such that irregularity in the signals which could be vital, will not be lost in the sensing process. Additionally, the student will look at algorithms to best reconstruct the compressed data. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">In a nutshell, the project considers the following problems:</div><div style="text-align: justify;">• Compressive sensing of M2M sensor data to achieve low rate sampling while capturing all vital irregularities in the signals,</div><div style="text-align: justify;">• Design compressive sensing algorithms which are able to protect M2M sensor data from eavesdroppers or wireless sniffers,  </div><div style="text-align: justify;">• Optimising the reconstruction of compressed M2M data to remove noise and recover the original signal,</div><div style="text-align: justify;">• Study implications of applying compressed sensing in a practical M2M environment such as healthcare and smart energy networks.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">During the PhD programme, the student may undertake a placement at TREL’s Telecommunications Research Laboratory based in Bristol; while the student would benefit from the interactions with industrial researchers as well as the experience of working in an industrial laboratory, this is not mandated and is open to discussion.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">This studentship is available from October 2011 for a period of up to 4 years and is funded jointly by the EPSRC through the 2011 Dorothy Hodgkin Postgraduate Award Scheme (DHPA) and by Toshiba Research Europe Ltd. The award provides an annual stipend ca. £13,590 per annum plus an enhancement of £1,430 per annum and full payment of Overseas Tuition Fees. Due to funding restrictions this studentship is only open to students from the countries listed at the OECD website - http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/62/48/41655745.pdf - plus Russia and Hong Kong.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">We are seeking students with equivalent of a UK first class honours degree, from a reputable academic institution. We welcome candidates who have strong backgrounds in one of the following areas: electronics and electrical engineering, computer science, applied mathematics, system control, or related disciplines</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The project will be supervised by Dr. Rob Piechocki of CCR, and Drs Woon Hau Chin and Zhong Fan at Toshiba Research Europe Ltd. Further details of the CCR’s work are at: www.bristol.ac.uk/ccr.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Further details of the studentship can be found at:&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/ResearchCareers/dhpa</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Please e-mail your application to&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">http://www.bristol.ac.uk/prospectus/postgraduate/2011/intro/apply.html and use this same address if you have questions or would like to have an informal discussion about the post and the research project.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The start date is as soon as possible after the 1 October 2011 and no later than 1 October 2012. This studentship is open until filled.</div></blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><!-- Site Meter XHTML Strict 1.0 -->

<p style="text-align: center;">“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Over the years, folks have often asked me what kind of math am I using to create large scale, real-time, <a href="http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/jeff_jonas/2006/08/accumulating_co.html">context accumulating</a> systems (<em>e.g.,</em> <a href="http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/jeff_jonas/2006/11/ieee_paper_thre.html">NORA</a>).&#0160; Some fond of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian">Bayesian</a> speculate I am using Bayesian techniques.&#0160; Some ask if I am using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristics</a>. &#0160;A math professor said I was doing advanced work in the field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">Set Theory</a>.</p>
<p>My answer is always, “I don’t know any math.&#0160; I didn’t finish high school.&#0160; But I can explain how it works, step-by-step, and it is really quite simple.”</p>
<p>That reminds me of a related funny story.&#0160; After IBM acquired my SRD company in 2005 I began touring IBM’s impressive research facilities around the world.&#0160; During a visit to <a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/http:/www.almaden.ibm.com/">IBM’s Almaden Research Center</a> I explained my techniques to a room full of researchers.&#0160; A few months later, to my surprise, they sent me a technical paper to express my work … using math.&#0160; Fascinating I thought.&#0160; The idea that my algorithms are now expressed in math terms was really exciting.&#0160; Could it be?&#0160; I was so curious.&#0160; So I asked them to humor me and take me through the paper very slowly via a conference call.&#0160; It was actually a bit embarrassing.&#0160; I started out by asking the question what does an equal sign mean when a colon is in front of it?&#0160; Symbol by symbol I asked for an explanation.&#0160; Then I asked about this thing shaped like the letter “U” … what does that mean?&#0160; (Union as it turns out).&#0160; Anyway, I was able to follow the math and it all made sense until about halfway through the paper when I spotted an obvious error.&#0160; So I said, “um, the math here is inconsistent with my technique.” &#0160;I suggested a fix.&#0160; The phone went quiet for a minute and then about 45 days later they came back with a new and improved paper.&#0160; Continuing where we left off, I found a similar discrepancy further down the page and then provided some more specifics about my technique.&#0160; Unfortunately, I never received another draft.&#0160; Clearly, they could have.&#0160; But honestly, I suspect they simply lost interest in having to teach me math.</p>
<p>I wish we would have finished that paper, as then folks trained in formal methods would better understand what I am doing and seeing.</p>
<p>One of the things demonstrated by this mathy paper might have been the notion that “data beats math” – at least when it comes to <em>Assertion Algorithms</em>.&#0160; Based on the available observation space, can an assertion be made?&#0160; Yes or no.&#0160; In short, there comes a point where sufficient evidence exists such that an assertion can be made as a “no-brainer” without feeling compelled to split hairs with probability math.</p>
<p>Here is practical example.&#0160; Imagine being presented with two identity records?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Record #1 </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Name: Mark Smith</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Date of Birth: 05/12/1987</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SSN: 555-00-1122</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Record #2 </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Name: Mark Smith</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Date of Birth: May 1987</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D/L: 0099912334</p>
<p>Are they the same person?&#0160; It is certainly possible.&#0160; Using population statistics and some math someone could compute a reasonably accurate probability.&#0160; I say heck with using math to guess.&#0160; I’d say where can I find some <a href="http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/jeff_jonas/2007/07/how-to-use-a-gl.html" target="_self">glue</a> around here?&#0160; For example, a record like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Record #3</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Name: Mark K Smith</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Date of Birth: May 12, 1987</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D/L: 0099912334</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SSN: 555-00-1122</p>
<p>So the point is: I’d rather look for corroborating and/or dissenting evidence than look to math for estimated probabilities.&#0160; And if a really important outcome might come from such an assertion, I would continue to seek observations until it was so obvious you could show the board of directors and they would say “duh.”&#0160; If you run out of available observations and you are still not sure … then you have a few choices: 1) locate and collect the kinds of observations you need, 2) wait until you luck into a future observation related to the assertion in question (letting the existing ambiguity fester), or 3) pound on it with math.&#0160; But I say only pound on it with math if it is going to be worth the additional effort/compute (<em>e.g.,</em> you are playing high-stakes poker in Vegas).</p>
<p>My gripe, if any, is that way too many people are chipping away at hard problems and making no material gains in decades (<em>e.g.,</em> entity extraction and classification) … when what they actually need is more data.&#0160; Not more of same data, by the way.&#0160; No, they more likely need orthogonal data – data from a different sensor sharing some of the same domain, entities and features (<em>e.g.,</em> name and driver’s license number).</p>
<p>When the quality of mathematical predictions start to flatten out, I recommend increasing your observation space.&#0160; Hence the above reference to this awesome quote:</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</p>

<div>Description: </div>
<div>Content:
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In the next two weeks, I will publish something new ... a novella (i.e. longer than a short story, shorter than a novel) titled<b style="color: blue;"> 'Gliebers Dresses:&nbsp; Catalogs on Trial'</b>.&nbsp; Below, enjoy an anticipated list of frequently asked questions.&nbsp; And then please buy the novella, ok?</span><br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Question:&nbsp; Will the novella be available in print?</span></b><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">No.&nbsp; And I can already hear folks howling ... "I don't have a Kindle, how will I be able to read this?" or "I don't have an iPad, how will I be able to read this?", or "are you an idiot, you need a multi-channel approach of print and digital".&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Here's the deal, folks.&nbsp; Sometimes, you have to test things.&nbsp; You have to try to do something out of the ordinary, or how are you ever going to learn how to chart a course to the future?&nbsp; So I am going to test a digital-only strategy.&nbsp; I will tell you how a digital-only strategy performs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Even more important ... why should I charge you $7.95 so that Createspace can take $3.00 and and Amazon can take $3.00 and I get somewhere short of two dollars and you get the book in a week and you spend money compensating Amazon and Createspace for something that you have no idea will be any good?&nbsp; How does that benefit you?&nbsp; You know what benefits you?&nbsp; $0.99 where I get very little money and <b style="color: blue;">you spread the word when you like the novella</b> ... if I don't do a good job, you don't spread the word, and I don't make money.&nbsp; Isn't that a better business model? </span></li>
</ul><b><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Question:&nbsp; How do I gain access to the book if it isn't available in print?</span></b><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You will have three choices.&nbsp; You can purchase the book for your Kindle, for your Nook, or <a href="mailto:kevinh@minethatdata.com">you can send me an e-mail message in the next 48 hours, and I will forward you a PDF of the book the day after the book is available digitally</a>.&nbsp; <span style="color: #cc0000;">This will be your only opportunity to receive a free copy of the novella.</span></span></li>
</ul><b><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Question:&nbsp; How much will the novella cost?</span></b><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I anticipate that the novella will cost no more than $0.99.</span></li>
</ul><b><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Question:&nbsp; Why should I buy this, when you've always written these stories for free?</span></b><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Again, how do you ever learn if you don't test things?&nbsp; If you follow best practices, you're going to end up with a very boring, sanitary, mediocre outcome.&nbsp; Let's try something different.</span></li>
</ul><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span><br />
<div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Question:&nbsp; Why Fiction?</b></div><ul><li style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Where do I start?&nbsp; I've written real posts, I've tweeted real messages, and I've written the Gliebers Dresses story.&nbsp; You are more likely to absorb information if the message is written in a fictional story.&nbsp; If I write the truth, folks have a tendency to criticize not the entire message, but a fraction of the message, throwing out the entire message as a result.&nbsp; I've learned that it is really hard for a reader to critique a fictional character.&nbsp; So, we'll go with fiction! </li>
</ul><b><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Question:&nbsp; What is the story about?</span></b><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In this novella, newly appointed CEO Roger Morgan is struggling with a floundering catalog business model that did not achieve the lofty expectations of experts who predicted that a multi-channel business model would produce unfettered success.&nbsp; So, Mr. Morgan orders that catalog marketing be "put on trial".&nbsp; Chip Cayman, well-known new media consultant, will play the role of the prosecuting attorney.&nbsp; Faith Kelley, executive administrative assistant, will defend catalog marketing.&nbsp; Mr. Morgan will be the Judge.&nbsp; The Executive Team will be witnesses.&nbsp; If catalog marketing is found guilty of being irrelevant in a new media environment, Gliebers Dresses will make dramatic changes to the business model.&nbsp; If catalog marketing is found innocent, expect a significant doubling of efforts in catalog marketing, going forward.&nbsp; What do you think will happen?</span></li>
</ul><b><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Question:&nbsp; Why should I care about this novella?</span></b><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">When is the last time your Executive Team had to truly defend your business model?&nbsp; Imagine being responsible for DVDs through the mail at Netflix ... could you defend the investment in your channel?&nbsp; Or being the retail executive at Blockbuster ... could you defend a continued investment in stores?&nbsp; Or being the CEO of Cuddledown of Maine ... could you defend your business model against a new media expert demanding that you stop mailing catalogs and instead supplement your business with iPad apps and social media and trigger-based e-mail marketing and paid search methodologies that are deeply integrated with your merchandising system?&nbsp; Could you, as a business leader, defend your channel in a court of law?&nbsp; How would you answer the tough questions?&nbsp; Could you be objective?&nbsp; Do you have the data to defend your channel?&nbsp; Give this a read, and then see if your Executive Team should be put through the paces that the Gliebers Dresses team is put through.</span></li>
</ul><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Your opportunity to purchase this novella is coming, in less than two weeks, maybe even later this week!!&nbsp; Be ready.</span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/32202893-9041697033014178320?l=blog.minethatdata.com' alt='' /></div><div class="feedflare">
